# --- semantic clustering -------------------------------------------------------
# Tasks are grouped by what they are ABOUT: a shared `epic:`, a shared source file, or a
# declared dependency. A file touched by more than hub_cap open tasks is treated as a hub
# (central config, main(), a barrel export) and does not link tasks — without that, one
# shared file fuses the whole backlog into a single cluster. Raise it if your clusters
# come out too fragmented; lower it if everything lands in cluster 1.

# --- co-change: files that historically change together, from raw history -------
# touches edges need a Task-Id, so a repo adopted brownfield has none and blast radius is
# unknown for everything. Co-change needs no trailers. Parameters are measured, not guessed
# (docs/DESIGN-NOTES.md): a minimum edge weight was tested and HURT, so there is no knob for
# one. max_degree is the self-check -- a graph whose average file co-changes with more than
# this is withheld rather than emitted, because answering "everything" is worse than unknown.

Prose below the frontmatter is for humans and for the overlay agents. Record what is
true of **this codebase** and nothing that is true of the stack in general — stack facts
belong in an accelerator, where other projects can reuse them.
