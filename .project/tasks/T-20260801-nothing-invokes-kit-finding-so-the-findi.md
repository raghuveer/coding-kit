title: Nothing invokes kit-finding so the findings loop is open circuit
epic: feedback-loop
tier: T2
state: open
---

## Intent

The README says findings "are recorded with language and defect class, which is the
mechanism by which the accelerators are improved from real work rather than invented."

On a real project that had run a T2 implementation review and a T3 design review, the
finding table held ZERO rows. Both reviewers had emitted correctly formatted
`Findings (recordable)` blocks. Nothing consumed them.

The agent files say the lines "are piped straight into `kit-finding.sh --batch`" -- but
nothing does the piping. No hook, no skill step, no script. It happens only if the
orchestrating session does it by hand, which means it happens when someone remembers,
which is the failure mode the checkpoint hook exists to avoid.

Consequence: every escape-rate and accelerator claim in the README is computed from an
empty table. `T0 0/2, T1 0/5, T2 0/7, T3 0/13` reads as "nothing escaped" and actually
means "nothing was recorded."

19 rows appeared the moment the blocks were piped in manually.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] findings reach the table without the operator remembering
- [ ] a review that produces findings and records none is visible as a warning, the way
      trailer discipline already is
- [ ] rejected findings are surfaced at the point of rejection, not discovered later by
      querying

## First T3 review: REVISE + REJECT, 15 findings, and the hook is disabled

Both reviewers rejected. Everything below was reproduced against the shipped script, not argued.
**`hooks/hooks.json` no longer invokes the harvester** — the wiring is removed until this is
fixed, because the worst failure is permanent: malformed lines appended to an append-only,
committed `events.ndjson`.

**critical — the gap cannot see what the harvester drops.** `EMITTED` counts lines that survived
the harvester's own regex, not lines the reviewer wrote. The harvester is STRICTER than the
recorder it feeds: `kit-finding.sh` accepts `fail-open | major | bash | |` (it strips spaces per
field) and loudly rejects `Major`, while the harvester silently discards both before counting.
Reproduced: 5 findings emitted, 3 recorded, 2 lost, **zero** `finding-gap` events. That is the
original defect one layer up — the measurement reads clean while findings were lost.

**major — it is `task_known()` for the third time, and twice in one file.** `agent_id` from the
hook payload is interpolated into a `grep` pattern (`:81-82`) and into a `find -name` glob
(`:75`). Reproduced: agent `A.9` suppressed agent `AB9`'s findings; `agent_id` of `*` harvested a
DIFFERENT agent's transcript and filed its findings under `*`. I filed
`T-20260809-a-task-id-containing-a-regex-metacharact` this morning, whose acceptance criteria
say "check the same shape elsewhere before closing", and then wrote the same shape twice this
afternoon.

**major — retracted draft findings are recorded.** Every occurrence of the heading re-arms the
harvest, so a reviewer that drafts a block, retracts it in prose and emits a final block gets all
of them. Reproduced: 3 rows for 1 intended finding, including a `race|critical` the reviewer
explicitly withdrew and a severity it had downgraded. Severity distribution is what escape rate
and the accelerators are read from.

**major — findings bind to unrelated REAL tasks.** The existence test inside the selected row
stops binding to a phantom; it does nothing about an unrelated real task committing first.
Reproduced: a T3 review's `fail-open|critical` bound to an unrelated **T0** task, counted at T0's
tier, unattributed count 0, nothing in the report. The commit claim "reports what it cannot bind
rather than guessing" is true only for the phantom case.

**major — the transcript's JSON envelope leaks into the log.** The last line of a block picks up
the trailing `"}]}}`, and `kit-finding.sh` interpolates every field into the event JSON without
escaping — `esc()` exists in the harvester and is applied only to the gap event. The result is a
malformed line, permanent in an append-only log, and a silently truncated `pattern`, which is the
column the technology accelerator is derived from. Four-field findings hit this; five-field ones
escape only because the garbage lands in `domain` and is dropped by luck.

**major — a reviewer that emits no block is invisible.** Hook exits 0 and writes nothing, so a
review that recorded nothing is indistinguishable from a clean one. `agent_type` is in the
payload and already read, so this is distinguishable and is not distinguished.

**minor — rejected findings' CONTENT is destroyed.** `kit-finding.sh` exits non-zero on rejection
on the stated ground that the caller still holds them; on the hook path the caller is a script
that then exits, the status is swallowed by command substitution, and the gap event carries only
counts. Also `\n`-unescaping corrupts any field containing a literal backslash, and there is no
Stop-hook sweep for a reviewer that dies before SubagentStop.

## RE-SCOPED 2026-08-10: the harvester is replaced, not repaired

The six principles below were written to harden `kit-review-findings.sh`, which scrapes a
reviewer's prose out of its transcript. That component is now being **deleted rather than
hardened** — `docs/LESSONS.md` §5, whose whole subject is this file. The reviewer returns
structured data and the orchestrator records it, so principles 2, 3 and 6 (pattern injection on
`agent_id`, transcript JSON extraction, forward-search attribution) cease to have a subject.
Principles 1, 4 and 5 survive and are implemented: one owner for validation, escape at the
writer, absence is a measurement.

**Built (2026-08-10):**

- `tooling/kit_findings.py` — the reader. Validates a reviewer's JSON against one contract and
  is the only thing with an opinion about a finding's shape. Rejection is **all-or-nothing**: a
  half-stored review is a finding table that disagrees with the review it came from.
- `kit-finding.sh --json` — records what the validator accepted. `--contract` prints the field
  list, exactly as `--vocab` prints the vocabulary, so agents reference and never restate it.
- `finding.summary`, `.file_path`, `.line_no` — the table could not previously hold what a
  finding WAS. Twelve rows recorded that morning read `fail-open|major|bash` and could not be
  told apart; `summary` is required for that reason.
- The four reviewer contracts in `agents/` now return one JSON object carrying `verdict`,
  `narrative` and `findings`, so nothing has to pull a fenced block out of markdown.

**No JSON Schema file.** One was written and deleted the same day. `jsonschema` is not
installed and the kit promises no runtime dependencies, so a schema file meant hand-writing a
subset interpreter of a standard — a second implementation, and a THIRD way to declare config
beside the project profile and the `--vocab` accessor. Reconsider only when something other
than this validator needs to consume it.

**What is NOT configurable, deliberately.** `class` and `severity` are a shared taxonomy: the
accelerators aggregate findings across projects and a per-project class list would make that
meaningless. `domain` is the axis that IS project-specific and is already declared in the
profile. That split is the answer to "why is this not external config".

**Not wired to the SubagentStop hook, and must not be.** `kit-review-findings.sh` stays
unwired: its worst failure appends malformed JSON to an append-only committed log, and its 15
findings are unfixed. The wiring is the orchestrator path, which is the decided design.

### Verified

Five mutations, each red in its own check, each restore verified clean by `git diff`:
all-or-nothing rejection, summary normalisation, absent-vs-empty, the validator asking for the
vocabulary rather than restating it, and `summary` being required.

**Wiring proof — a live reviewer, not a fixture.** Fixtures prove the recorder; only this
proves the loop, and it failed twice before it passed, both times in ways no fixture would have
shown:

1. The reviewer ignored the contract and called the harness's own `ReportFindings` tool,
   returning prose. **Worked around** — not fixed — by passing `--disallowedTools` and an
   overriding output rule on that one CLI invocation. Neither string exists in `agents/`,
   `skills/` or `hooks/`, so nothing in the kit carries the workaround; a T3 reviewer caught
   this sentence claiming otherwise on 2026-08-11, and it was §3 again, and mine.
2. It then returned correct JSON **wrapped in a ```json fence**, having been told in capitals
   not to. `unfence()` strips exactly one surrounding fence — the single concession to how
   models reply. It is not prose-scraping: every field still comes from a JSON parse, and a
   wrong unwrap fails as invalid JSON rather than producing a quietly wrong row. Prose around
   an object still fails loudly, asserted.
3. It then produced a **294-character summary** against the 200 cap and the whole batch was
   correctly rejected — the contract working, but the agents had never been told the limit.
   Now stated in all four.

After those, a real reviewer's output went into the recorder untouched by a human and produced
rows carrying class, severity, `pattern`, `file:line` and a readable summary.

## T3 review round on the contract (2026-08-11) — REJECTED by both, do not close

Two reviewers, read-only enforced by `--allowedTools`, launched together so the second was
blind. **`security-reviewer` (opus): REJECT, 17 findings, 3 critical. `implementation-reviewer`
(sonnet): REJECT, 7 findings, 1 critical.** All 24 recorded through `--json`, and this is the
first round in this repository whose finding rows carry a `summary` — the contract earning its
keep while being rejected by it.

Every claim below was reproduced by hand before being written here.

### Three convergent findings — both reviewers, independently

**C1. `record()` escapes only `summary`; `lang`, `pattern`, `domain` and `file` reach the
append-only log raw** (`kit-finding.sh:100`, critical in both reports). The validator
length-caps those fields but normalises none of them. A quote or backslash in any one writes a
permanently malformed line into `events.ndjson`, which is **committed and append-only** — and
that is precisely the harvester's critical defect this change was written to replace. Worse
(`sec:13`): `jf()`/`jn()` take the FIRST match, so 40 characters of reviewer-controlled `lang`
can inject a `summary`, `model` or `line` key that the indexer then prefers over the real one,
while the line still parses. Verified: the printf interpolates `$3 $4 $5 $6` unquoted and
`validate()` normalises only `row["summary"]`.

**C2. All-or-nothing is true of validation, not of writing** (`kit-finding.sh:157` / `:146`).
`record` appends inside the `while` loop and the loop contains a reachable `exit 2` on the
vocabulary re-check, so a batch can write rows and then fail. The claim in the commit message
and in the agent contracts — "one bad value and the whole batch records nothing" — is false for
anything the validator lets through. Verified by inspection.

**C3. The loop this task exists to close is STILL OPEN** (`skills/checkpoint/SKILL.md:47`,
`skills/verify-ladder/SKILL.md:50`, critical in `sec`). Both skills still instruct the operator
to pipe a `Findings (recordable)` block into `--batch` — a format **none of the four rewritten
reviewer contracts now produces**. The agents were rewritten and the skills were not, so the
documented recording path cannot work. Nothing anywhere invokes `--json`. Verified by grep.

### Also confirmed by hand

- **A control I wrote today that cannot fail** (`sec:8`, `conformance.sh:1246`). The
  "validator reads the vocabulary rather than restating it" step asserts only a non-zero exit,
  so it passes on a failed `cp`, a missing `python3`, or a syntax error. Reproduced: pointing it
  at a non-existent interpreter makes the assertion evaluate to PASS. This is `docs/LESSONS.md`
  §1 in a check written **to guard against exactly that class**, on the same day.
- **`--contract` is unreachable outside an active project** (`sec:9`). It sits in the second arg
  loop, after `kit_root`/`kit_active`, unlike `--vocab` which is dispatched at line 28. Run from
  `/tmp` it prints nothing and exits 0. Verified.
- **`--batch` and the single-flag path still create bare counters** (`sec:11`). Both call
  `record` with five arguments, so `summary` is empty — the row this change exists to abolish is
  still creatable at both documented doors.
- **No `finding-gap` event** (`sec:7`). A zero-finding review or a rejected batch emits stderr
  only, so principle 5 ("absence is a measurement") is unimplemented and the gap count in
  `kit-status.sh` will sit pinned at zero once the harvester is deleted.
- **The step named "the finding contract is defined in exactly one place" never compares the
  agents against `--contract`** (`sec:10`), while all four agents restate the field list. The
  name overpromises what the check does.
- **A subshell hazard I introduced** (`sec:15`, `conformance.sh:1180`): `( cd "$sj" && git init`
  chains only `git init`. With no `set -e`, a failed `cd` would run `kit-init.sh` and commit
  `T-j.md` **inside the kit's own repository**. Verified by inspection.
- **The task's own wiring-proof narrative is a false claim** (`sec:12`). It says the fix was
  "disallowing that tool and stating the output rule as overriding" — neither string exists in
  `agents/`, `skills/` or `hooks/`. Both were flags in an ad-hoc CLI invocation, not in the kit.
  §3 again, and mine.
- **`kit-review-findings.sh` still exists on disk** (`impl:5`) with its five defects, while the
  record says it is being deleted.
- **`summary`, `file_path`, `line_no` have no reader** (`sec:14`). No report or query selects
  them, so the benefit needs hand-written SQL to reach.
- **The hostile-input conformance case only sends a hostile character in `summary`**
  (`impl:6`), so C1 is invisible to CI by construction.

### The contract's own enforceability failed, measurably

Two reviewers, same instruction, one round: **one complied, one did not.** `sonnet` prefixed its
object with a sentence of prose, and `unfence()` correctly refused it — prose around an object
fails loudly, as designed and asserted. But the review then needed a human to trim the preamble
before it could be recorded, which is the very intervention acceptance criterion 1 forbids.

Both prior live runs failed the same way before passing (a reporting tool, then a fence). The
honest reading after three attempts: **a system-prompt instruction is not an enforcement
mechanism**, and the contract needs either a retry that feeds the validator's own diagnostics
back to the reviewer, or a tool-call whose arguments the API validates. That belongs in the fix
list, not in a footnote.

### Not to be re-litigated

Both reviewers accepted the settled decisions and attacked the execution, which is what was
asked. Neither found a reason to revisit the no-schema-file decision, the shared taxonomy, or
the read-only reviewer constraint.

## T3 round 4 on `d907522` (2026-08-11) — REJECTED by both, but no criticals

13 findings (security 8, implementation 5). **The three criticals of round 3 are gone and
neither reviewer found a new one** — the one-writer move held. What remains are consequences of
the fix and two sweeps I did not do. Every claim below reproduced by hand.

### Convergent — both reviewers, independently

**`task` is written raw while its neighbours are sanitised.** `kit_findings.py:270` and `:292`
insert `opts["task"]` unsanitised into both event kinds, beside `sanitise(opts["agent"])` and
`sanitise(opts["agent_id"])` on the same line. The docstring claiming sanitisation covers
"every string that reaches the log, not only `summary`" is therefore false — §3 again, in the
comment written to explain the §3 fix. It fails closed via `_assert_flat()` rather than
corrupting, but as an internal error rather than a diagnosis.

**The single append is unchecked.** `kit-finding.sh:113` runs `printf '%s\n' "$_out" >> "$EV"`
and never tests it. An unwritable or full `events.ndjson` still prints "recorded N finding(s)"
and exits 0. The comment above it claims one atomic append settles all-or-nothing; it settles
ordering, not success.

### The sweep I did not do — and it is the lesson I quoted in the brief

`docs/LESSONS.md` §4 says filing a defect class is not sweeping for it, and the sweep is the
cheap half. Round 3 found one subshell chaining only `cd`; I fixed that one. **There are 14
subshells of that shape in `tests/conformance.sh` and exactly 1 now carries the guard.** I
quoted §4 in the round-4 brief while leaving 13 instances of the shape I had just been shown.

### New, from the fixes

- **A rejected batch still emits no `finding-gap`** (`kit_findings.py:361`). The gap covers zero
  findings only; the case where findings genuinely are lost remains a stderr line. Principle 5
  is half implemented.
- **`kit-status.sh:398` misreads the gap it now gets.** The only gap this writer emits means
  "zero findings", but the report words it as reviews that emitted findings none of which were
  recorded. The number will be right and the sentence wrong.
- **Outside an active project the recorder destroys a piped review silently.** `kit_active ||
  exit 0` runs before stdin is read, so the review is consumed and discarded with exit 0 and no
  output. Reproduced from `/tmp`. This is the fail-open shape at the CLI door.
- **The `--contract` reachability fix has no test** — the step runs inside the kit repo, which
  has a profile, so moving it back into the arg loop would stay green.
- **Deleting `--batch` was not swept through the backlog.** `T-20260808-record-which-mechanism-produced-a-findin`
  still carries an acceptance criterion requiring `--batch` to accept a new field.
- **`--vocab` and `--contract` now work only as the FIRST argument**, so
  `kit-finding.sh --task T --vocab` exits 2. A regression from moving them to early dispatch.

### Triage confirmed

The reviewers were asked to judge my sweep of the other printf-JSON writers rather than
rediscover it, and neither escalated it into this task: `kit-event.sh`'s raw `payload`,
`kit-vindicate.sh`'s unescaped `task`/`class`, and the rest stay a neighbouring task.

### The contract's enforceability, four rounds in

`security-reviewer` (opus) conformed; `implementation-reviewer` (sonnet) did not, this time with
a 208-character summary, and recording it needed a hand truncation — the intervention AC1
forbids. Across four live runs: **opus 2/2 compliant, sonnet 0/3** (a reporting tool, a preamble,
an over-long summary). That is a small sample and worth stating as one, but it points the same
way each time, and it bears directly on the register's R-10 idea of running a compliance pass at
a cheaper capability.

## The retry loop (2026-08-11) — what closes acceptance criterion 1

Four live runs, three non-compliances: a reporting tool called instead of answering, an object
wrapped in a ```json fence, a 208-character summary. Each time a human read the diagnostics and
repaired the reply by hand — the intervention AC1 forbids. **A system prompt is a request, not
a mechanism.** `tooling/kit-review-record.sh` is the mechanism.

    kit-review-record.sh --task T --agent implementation-reviewer --max-attempts 3 \
      --prompt-file request.txt --cmd '<reads a prompt on stdin, writes the reply to stdout>'

- **It does not spawn the reviewer.** `--cmd` is the caller's, and it is the only thing that
  knows how a reviewer is invoked here — so no harness, CLI or model name enters the kit. That
  keeps the boundary the profile already draws, and keeps the loop usable from a different
  harness later without touching it.
- **The correction is the validator's own output, verbatim** (`kit_findings.py --correction`,
  exit 3 to distinguish "retryable" from "your call was wrong"). Nothing composes a description
  of what went wrong, so a retry cannot drift from what was actually rejected.
- **Bounded, and the bound is load-bearing**: a reviewer that cannot comply in N tries will not
  comply in twenty, and an unbounded loop against a paid endpoint is a bill.
- **Every exit path that is not success records a `finding-gap`.** A reviewer that never
  complied is a hole in the measurement; silence there is the open circuit this task is named
  after.
- **A reviewer command that fails is NOT retried.** A broken invocation is not a contract
  violation, and retrying it spends a budget on nothing.

### Verified

The conformance fixture is a **fake reviewer, not a model**: it fails first, and succeeds only
if the correction text actually reaches it — so a loop that retried blindly would fail the test
even though the attempt count matched. Three paths asserted: corrected-and-recorded, incorrigible
(bounded, gap, exit 1), and broken command (no retry, gap).

Mutation notes: removing the bound outright makes the fixture loop forever, and killing that
reliably means reaping a process tree the parent no longer controls — it hung the harness twice
and left a mutated file behind both times. The mutation is therefore `max + 5`: still bounded,
still caught, because the step asserts the exact attempt count rather than merely that it
stopped.

## T3 round 5 on `5317337` (2026-08-11) — REJECTED. One critical, in the new loop.

15 findings (security 12, implementation 3). **Every one is in `kit-review-record.sh` or its
fixture** — nothing in the contract stack the previous four rounds hardened was found again.

**This round was run THROUGH the loop it was reviewing**, which is the wiring proof acceptance
criterion 1 needs: `implementation-reviewer` was refused on attempt 1, the validator's own
diagnostics were handed back automatically, attempt 2 was accepted, and 3 findings were
recorded — **with no human in the path**. `security-reviewer` complied first time and recorded
12. Across five rounds the compliance split is now opus 3/3, sonnet 0/4 — and for the first
time sonnet's non-compliance cost nothing, because the loop repaired it.

### CRITICAL — the loop can report a clean review that never happened

`kit-review-record.sh:60`. `--prompt-file` is read with `[ -n "$prompt_file" ] && prompt=$(cat
"$prompt_file")` and **the failure of `cat` is ignored**, as is the case where the flag is
omitted entirely. The reviewer is then handed an EMPTY prompt, replies with nothing, and that
is recorded as `reason=empty` — the gap value that means *"a review looked and found nothing"*
— and the loop **exits 0**.

Reproduced: pointing `--prompt-file` at a non-existent path prints one `cat:` line to stderr and
then reports success with an `empty` gap. This is the false-clean the entire task exists to
prevent, rebuilt inside the mechanism meant to close it. A missing prompt must be a usage error
before the first attempt.

### Majors

- **`pipefail` turns a compliant review into a broken command** (`:69`). `printf | sh -c "$cmd"`
  under `set -o pipefail`: a reviewer that does not drain stdin kills `printf` with SIGPIPE, the
  pipeline reports failure, the reply is discarded and a false gap recorded. The wrapper used
  today happens to drain; nothing requires that.
- **A validator failure that is not a refusal resends an empty prompt** (`:79`). Missing
  `python3`, or an undecodable reply, exits non-zero with empty stdout, which is read as a
  refusal — so `prompt=$correction` becomes empty and every remaining attempt reviews nothing.
- **The INT trap deletes the workdir without exiting** (`:65`), so Ctrl-C falls through to the
  tail and writes a `rejected` gap into the committed log instead of cancelling.
- **`$ATTR` is unquoted at three sites** (`:54`), so a task id containing whitespace or a glob
  breaks both the recorder and the gap call — losing the review with no row at all.
- **The tail gap append is unchecked and does not `mkdir -p`** (`:107`) — the same defect
  round 4 fixed in `kit-finding.sh`, reintroduced one file over. §4 again.
- **A broken command is recorded as `rejected`** (`:106`), whose report text claims findings were
  refused "for an unrecognised class or severity, or a malformed field". No findings ever
  existed. The reason vocabulary needs a third value.
- **The fixture asserts gap COUNT but never reason, task or agent** (`conformance.sh:1363`), and
  builds none of the non-draining, missing-prompt-file or validator-failure paths — so the
  "Verified" section above overclaims what is covered. §3, and mine.

### Minors worth keeping

Double gap when the recorder refuses a reply the validator accepted; the `mktemp` fallback path
under `TMPDIR` is predictable and `mkdir -p` accepts a pre-created or symlinked directory; no
timeout or output cap on the reviewer command, so the bound counts attempts but not time or
disk; the exit-3/exit-2 distinction is never actually read by the only caller; and
reviewer-controlled text is interpolated into the correction prompt sent back to a model, which
is prompt injection into the retry (OWASP LLM01).

### What this round did NOT find

No new defect in `kit_findings.py`'s validation, sanitisation, `_assert_flat`, the all-or-nothing
write, the gap vocabulary, or the recorder — the parts rounds 1-4 hardened. The convergence is
that new code is where defects live, which is the argument for reviewing a fix as carefully as
the thing it fixed.

## The approach, and why each piece is shaped that way

Six principles, because patching seven symptoms would leave the eighth.

1. **One owner for validation.** The harvester stops deciding what a finding looks like. It
   extracts every non-empty line between the heading and the next heading and hands all of them
   to `kit-finding.sh`, which already owns the vocabulary and already reports per line. This
   deletes the stricter-than-the-recorder class permanently rather than aligning two regexes that
   will drift again — the vocabulary drifted across four files once already.
2. **Never interpolate an untrusted field into a pattern.** `agent_id` is compared as a fixed
   string, and the transcript is located with a direct path test rather than `find -name`. A
   charset check on `agent_id` before it is used in a path at all, so a traversal or glob cannot
   be expressed.
3. **Parse the transcript as data, not as text.** Extract the JSON string value and decode its
   escapes explicitly, rather than `sed`-unescaping a whole line and hoping the envelope is not
   caught. This is what kills both the `"}]}}` leak and the backslash corruption.
4. **Escape at the writer.** `kit-finding.sh` escapes every field it interpolates into the event
   JSON. `events.ndjson` must stay parseable line by line no matter what a reviewer emits.
5. **Absence is a measurement.** A reviewer that emits nothing, or whose findings are all
   rejected, emits `finding-gap` carrying the rejected lines themselves — not counts alone, which
   cannot be acted on once the reviewer is gone.
6. **Do not guess attribution.** Bound the forward search so a finding cannot bind to a task
   whose transition is arbitrarily far away or in another session; what falls outside the bound is
   reported as unattributed, which is already a supported and visible state.

**Only the last block is harvested**, on the same reasoning as 5: a superseded draft is not a
finding, and "last message wins" is the only rule that matches how a reviewer actually works.

## Notes

Interacts with [[T-20260801-reviewer-agents-cannot-run-the-tools-the]]: even once
something does the piping, roughly half the emitted findings are currently rejected for
unknown classes, so fixing the plumbing alone would record a biased sample.

The checkpoint hook is the obvious home, but it fires per work unit and reviews happen
mid-unit, so the findings would need somewhere to accumulate first.

**2026-09-11 — plugin mode, measured.** On the highper-gateway plugin-mode trial, **11 of 11 findings
landed only because the session ran `kit-finding.sh --json` by hand** after each reviewer returned;
nothing in plugin mode invoked it. `kit-review-record.sh`'s `--cmd` wants a command that reads a
prompt on stdin and writes a reply to stdout. The plugin's own reviewers are Agent-tool subagents
with no such command, and a separate `claude -p` would be a different session, whose spend this
session's hooks never see. So in plugin mode the retry loop this task built has no caller shape at
all. Related: `T-20260911-a-finding-recorded-by-hand-carries-no-ag`, because the by-hand door also
drops `agent_id`. Evidence: `docs/TRIALS/2026-09-09-highper-gateway-plugin-mode/trial-notes.md`, at
13:40–13:44Z and 14:01:04Z.
