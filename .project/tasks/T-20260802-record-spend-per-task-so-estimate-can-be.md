title: Record spend per task so estimate can be compared to actual
epic: measurement
tier: T2
blocked_by: T-20260801-validate-a-task-s-recorded-tier-against-
state: open
---

## Intent

The kit records defects and state but never cost. Event kinds are checkpoint, finding and
vindication; the schema has no token or duration column. So the one number a delivery
estimate is judged against -- did this cost what we said it would -- cannot be computed from
anything the kit stores.

Cost is a function of tier and tier is assigned before spawning, so a tiered backlog is
already a forecast. The forecast side exists; the actual side does not.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] a spend event records tokens per agent invocation, with agent, model and task
- [x] the index derives cost per task and per tier from those events
- [x] status-report shows estimated against actual for the open backlog
- [x] a task with no spend recorded is visibly absent rather than counted as zero
- [x] recording is a side effect of work already being done, not a separate ritual

## Notes

The last criterion is the one that decides whether this survives. Trailer discipline works
because recording status is a side effect of the commit you were making anyway. A spend
record that requires someone to remember will be missing exactly on the busy tasks that
matter most, and a partial cost table is worse than none -- it reads as cheap work rather
than as unmeasured work, which is the same failure the escape rate had when the findings
loop was open circuit.

Tier accuracy is a prerequisite, not an adjacent concern. Two of three recorded tiers
measured too low, both in the direction that under-predicts, because the backlog was tiered
from finding severity and never checked against tier.rule floors. A forecast on those tiers
reads low and then overruns. See T-20260801-validate-a-task-s-recorded-tier-against-.

Measured baselines to forecast against, from docs/MEASUREMENTS.md: T2 task 220,336 including
review; T3 design stage 196,060 for researcher plus two reviewers. Both n=1, both on a
greenfield project, so they are a starting point rather than a rate card.

## Outcome

Recorded from the SubagentStop and Stop hooks, so nobody types it. No hook carries token
usage, so the transcript is the only source -- every assistant record holds a `usage` block
and kit-spend.sh sums them.

Keyed on the TRANSCRIPT, not the agent, and totals are cumulative. That is correct whichever
way the harness resolves transcript_path: per-subagent transcripts give one row each, a
shared session transcript gives one row overwritten with a rising total. Summing distinct
transcripts never double counts. Verified: recording the same transcript twice yields one
row at the true figure, not two.

Attribution is derived, not recorded -- the hook has no idea which task an agent served, so
spend attaches to the next task-status transition. A heuristic, and unattributed spend is
reported rather than dropped for the same reason a classless finding is dropped loudly: a
cost table missing its expensive rows reads as cheap work rather than as measurement that did
not happen.

The forecast uses THIS project's own closed tasks as the rate. A tier with no closed
measurement is printed as "no rate yet" rather than treated as free.

**Superseded in part, 2026-08-08.** Two claims above are wrong and are left standing because
they are what the evidence supported at the time. The session transcript is NOT the only
source -- each subagent has its own, and the session's contains none of their records, so
"keyed on the transcript, not the agent" produced rows holding main-loop cost under an
agent's name. And summing the four counters is not cost: they are billed at ratios of 1,
1.25, 0.1 and 5. See T-20260802-spend-reads-the-session-transcript-so-su for what replaced
both. The shape here -- recorded from hooks so nobody types it, attribution derived from the
next task-status transition, unattributed spend reported rather than dropped -- survived
unchanged.
