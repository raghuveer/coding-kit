# ai-assisted-claude-coding-kit

A risk-tiered review pipeline and derived project state for AI-assisted coding with
Claude Code. Stack-agnostic baseline.

## Where this came from

This was **extracted from a subagent pipeline already in use on a large project**, not
designed from scratch. The history shows the shape of that extraction:

| | |
|---|---|
| `0.1` — 2026-07-26 | The agent set as copyable files: eight core agents, a core/overlay split, a PowerShell script to sync them into a project, and a profile template. A distribution mechanism for agents that already existed. |
| `0.2.0` — 2026-07-29 | The turn from copying to a plugin, and the point at which **state and context management became the product**: derived project state, semantic task clustering, commands to skills, the checkpoint to a hook. |

The reason for extracting it was to productise what was being tuned by hand — state and
context management for quality outcomes at controlled token cost — so it could be pointed at
other projects instead of one. Everything since 0.2.0 is that work: measuring what the
pipeline costs, making the state derived rather than maintained, and closing the gaps that
only appear when the same machinery meets an unfamiliar codebase.

Two consequences worth stating up front. The kit has been **measured on exactly one project**,
greenfield and single-stack (`docs/MEASUREMENTS.md`, n=1 per cell) — brownfield and polyglot
are the untested cases, and the backlog says so. And the agents predate the kit, so the
pipeline is older and better exercised than the state layer wrapped around it.

## What changed in 0.2.0

- **Distributed as a plugin**, not copied. Copies drift; versions are what make feedback
  from other developers interpretable.
- **Status is derived, not maintained.** Task files and git trailers are the truth.
  SQLite is a rebuildable index. `STATUS.generated.md` is output.
- **Zero MCP servers.** `git` and `sqlite3` are Bash calls at no resident cost. The original
  reason given here — that an MCP server charges its tool definitions on every request,
  forever — **is no longer true and has been corrected**: Claude Code defers MCP tool schemas
  by default, so only names and server instructions stay resident. The decision stands on a
  different and better reason. Deferral reverts to full upfront loading behind a
  non-first-party proxy, on some cloud deployments, and when experimental betas are disabled,
  and a plugin cannot control any of those — so a component that costs a few hundred tokens
  here and tens of thousands there is one this kit cannot honestly put a resident number on.
  See `T-20260808-the-readme-argues-zero-mcp-from-a-cost-m`.
- **Commands became skills — except the checkpoint, which became a hook.** A checkpoint
  that depends on someone typing `/checkpoint` is skipped exactly when sessions run long.
- **Findings are recorded with language and defect class**, which is the mechanism by
  which the accelerators are improved from real work rather than invented.

## Three principles

1. **One kind of truth, one file.** Anything derivable is derived. Nothing is maintained
   in two places.
2. **Verify at the level the failure lives.** The ladder states obligations, not commands.
   A rung with no tooling in this stack is *declared unavailable and raises the tier* —
   less mechanical verification means more adversarial reading, not a lower bar.
3. **Spawning is the cost lever, and reuse is the only way to lower it.** Tier before
   spawning, because one task is two agents and one design stage is three. Then make the
   result reusable — a finding that becomes an accelerator is paid for once, and a session
   trimmed by a few thousand tokens is not.

## What it costs

From a real greenfield run, n=1, with the caveats stated below each row — two of these are
context size rather than billed cost and the third is an estimate. Full figures and method in
[`docs/MEASUREMENTS.md`](docs/MEASUREMENTS.md).

| | tokens |
|---|---|
| One T2 task — coder + implementation review | **220,336** |
| One T3 design stage — researcher + two reviewers | **196,060** |
| Resident always-on cost | **~1,259** — *estimated, not measured* |

The first two rows are the harness's per-agent figure, which a later spike identified as
**context size rather than billed cost** — see the provenance note in `docs/MEASUREMENTS.md`.
They are the right order of magnitude and the right ordering; they are not a price, and the
kit now records what is needed to restate them properly.

The third row is an **estimate**, not a measurement: it is a hand-built table in
`docs/HANDOFF.md`, and the only tooling behind it is a flat `~100 tokens` per skill heuristic
in `validate.py`. It previously appeared here as "0.57% of one task", which divided that
estimate by 220,336 — a context-size figure. Two different units, so the ratio meant nothing.
Both numbers need re-deriving before either is quoted as cost again.

**This kit does not save tokens. It spends them deliberately.** The resident cost of having
the plugin installed is a rounding error next to a single task, by roughly two orders of
magnitude — that much survives even though the precise ratio does not, because the two
figures are in different units. Optimising the resident cost is not where the money is, and a
document that leads with it is pointing at the wrong number.

The cost lever is **how many agents you spawn and on which model**, which is what
`tier-classify` exists to decide. And the models cannot simply be downgraded: measured on
one design review, haiku missed the critical security finding entirely and sonnet found it
but returned REVISE where opus returned REJECT — a calibration failure, and the more
dangerous kind. The tiering is expensive on purpose.

### What that buys

On the same project: two High security findings absent from a 28-item human review
register, and two escapes found in work that had already passed review and been committed.
One of those escapes had `ladder.rung3` reporting **available** while proving nothing, so
every task was being reviewed one rung shallow.

Whether that is worth 220k per task is a judgement about your defect economics, and the kit
should give you the number rather than an adjective.

### The bet

Per project, per task, this costs more than it returns. The wager that changes that is
**amortisation**: the 196k spent designing a cache port is a one-time cost if it becomes an
accelerator and a recurring one if it does not. Trimming context within a session cannot
compete with not re-deriving the same design in the next project.

That bet is currently **unproven**. It was unprovable until the findings loop was repaired,
because nothing was accumulating. The test that settles it is to earn an accelerator on one
project, import it into a second, and measure whether the equivalent stage costs 196k or
30k. The first attempt at that test had to be scored on verdicts and finding content
instead, because the cost side was measuring the wrong entity; per-agent spend recording is
what makes the token half of it runnable.

### Predictability, which may matter more than the total

Cost here is a function of **tier**, and tier is assigned *before* anything spawns. A T2 task
is a coder and a reviewer; a T3 design stage is a researcher and two. So a tiered backlog is
already a forecast — `N × T2 + M × T3` against measured per-tier figures — and the tiering
step the kit performs for risk reasons happens to be the same step that makes spend
estimable.

Two things stood between that and a usable number. One is closed, one is open:

**Spend is recorded, per agent, and weighted.** A `spend` event is written from the
`SubagentStop` and `Stop` hooks, so nobody has to remember it, and it is read from each
agent's own transcript rather than the session's — the first version read the session's and
therefore reported the operator's tokens under a subagent's name. The four counters are
stored raw and priced at report time, because they are not interchangeable: adding them up
prices a cache read like fresh input and reports roughly seven times the truth, and the
harness's own per-agent figure is a third thing again — final context size, blind to work
done. Estimate-versus-actual is now a derived metric exactly like escape rate.

**Tier accuracy becomes load-bearing.** Measured on three tasks with two independent
classifiers each, two of three recorded tiers were too low — and both errors were in the
direction that under-predicts. A forecast built on tiers assigned from finding *severity*
rather than checked against the project's own `tier.rule` floors will read low and then
overrun. That makes tier-floor validation a budgeting control, not only a review control.

For work where the estimate is committed to a client before the work starts, this is arguably
the more useful property than the absolute figure. A predictable 220k beats an unpredictable
120k.

### Resident cost, for completeness

~1,259 tok: five skills at ~440, eight subagent descriptions at ~840, hooks and MCP at zero.
Agent descriptions are resident because routing matches against them, so all eight are in
context whether or not any runs. Bodies load only on use.

It is a footnote, not a headline — but it is why **accelerators arrive as reference files
rather than new skills or agents**: a reference file costs nothing until read, and the
catalogue is meant to grow without bound.

## Install

```sh
/plugin marketplace add raghuveer/ai-assisted-claude-coding-kit
/plugin install coding-kit@ai-assisted-claude-coding-kit
```

`coding-kit` is the plugin; `ai-assisted-claude-coding-kit` is the marketplace that
carries it. They are not interchangeable in that second command.

Pin a version when handing it to others — `@ref` with no version resolves to the default
branch, which moves:

```sh
/plugin marketplace add raghuveer/ai-assisted-claude-coding-kit@v0.2.0
```

Then, in each repo that should use it:

```sh
bash ~/.claude/plugins/cache/ai-assisted-claude-coding-kit/tooling/kit-init.sh
```

The kit is **inert** in any repo without `.claude/project-profile.md` — every script
exits silently and creates nothing. It will be enabled in other people's unrelated
projects; it must not litter them.

## State lives in the project repo

```
.project/tasks/*.md      source of truth — intent, acceptance criteria   (committed)
.project/events.ndjson   append-only transitions and findings            (committed)
.project/index.db        derived index                                   (gitignored)
STATUS.generated.md      generated view                                  (gitignored)
```

Never in plugin storage: that is tied to the plugin's lifecycle, so uninstalling would
take a project's history with it. Deleting `index.db` and rebuilding must always be
lossless — that invariant is what keeps the index from quietly becoming a second truth.

## Dependencies

`git` **2.32 or newer** — older git cannot expand `%(trailers:…,valueonly)`, so every
commit would index as untagged; `kit-index.sh` warns if it finds one.

`sqlite3` **3.25 or newer** for cluster context packs, which use window functions.
Everything else works on 3.8+; `kit-plan.sh` warns and withholds the packs rather than
failing, so an older sqlite costs you the caching, not the plan.

Plus the POSIX text utilities that ship alongside those: `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, `sort`,
`cut`, `tr`, `wc`. No language runtime — `validate.py` is the one exception, and it is an
authoring check never run by the kit itself. Bash is reachable on Windows via the shell git
already ships, and git is a hard dependency anyway since status is derived from it.

## Platforms

| | verified on | awk | bash |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux | CI, every push | mawk | 5.2 |
| macOS | CI, every push | one-true-awk 20200816 | **3.2.57** |
| Windows | git-bash | gawk 5.0 | 5.2 |

Not a compatibility claim — `tests/conformance.sh` builds a fixture with fixed author and
committer dates, so every commit SHA is identical everywhere, and asserts that the derived
index comes out byte-identical. All three currently produce the same fingerprint.

That check exists because it earned its place: running one fixture on a second platform is
what exposed timestamps being stored with the author's local offset and compared as strings,
which could derive state from the wrong commit. Neither platform showed anything wrong
alone — only the diff between them did.

## Trailers — frozen once adopted

Trailers are written into commit history, so changing the vocabulary later means either
rewriting history or parsing two dialects forever.

| Trailer | Required | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `Task-Id:` | non-trivial commits | task ID |
| `Tier:` | non-trivial commits | `T0` `T1` `T2` `T3` |
| `Task-Status:` | when it changes | `created` `planned` `in-progress` `on-hold` `completed` `cancelled` `abandoned` |
| `Fixes-Escape-Of:` | on escape fixes | task ID |

**`cancelled` and `abandoned` are not synonyms, and the difference is the one worth learning.**
`abandoned` judges the **attempt** — we stopped. `cancelled` judges the **work** — this should not
be done at all. Collapsing them loses the distinction exactly where a brownfield inventory needs
it, on the first day, across possibly most of the backlog: a pile of items that were never work,
filed as abandoned, reads as a project that abandons a great deal. Only `cancelled` is excluded
from the escape-rate denominator, because work that was never work cannot judge the pipeline.

Older spellings — `open` `started` `progress` `unblocked` `blocked` `done` — **remain valid input
forever** and resolve to the values above when the index is built. No task file and no commit has
to be rewritten. See [`docs/adr/0008`](docs/adr/0008-the-task-state-vocabulary-and-its-partitions.md).

`Tier:` is not bookkeeping. Without it, escape rate per tier is not computable, and the
tier table in `project-profile.md` stays a guess instead of becoming a measured output.

**Trailers must be the last paragraph.** Git only parses a trailer block at the end of the
message, so anything after them — most commonly the `Co-authored-by:` lines GitHub appends
on squash-merge — strands them where `%(trailers:)` cannot see them. The `commit-msg` hook
rejects that shape, and `kit-index.sh` recovers it with a full-message scan and says so,
because a merge flow that mangles trailers will also defeat anything else that reads them.

**Enforcement has three points, and they are not redundant.** `commit-msg` catches a
trailer while you are still writing it. `pre-push` catches one that got past `--no-verify`
or past a teammate who never ran `kit-init.sh` — and it is the last moment a commit message
can be amended, because after a push a wrong `Task-Id` is permanent. CI catches what reaches
the remote regardless. What gets through all three is reported rather than counted: an id no
task file backs is named under `Unresolved task ids` with the commit that introduced it, and
is in no backlog total or escape-rate denominator.

`.git/hooks/` is per-clone and git cannot share it, so the first two protect only developers
who ran `kit-init.sh`. Copy
`templates/github-trailer-gate.yml` into `.github/workflows/` for the server-side check
that survives a clone. Both call the same validator — `tooling/kit-trailers.sh` — because
two copies of these rules would drift, which is the bug 0.2.1 existed to fix.

## Accelerators

Imported per project, never installed globally. See `accelerators/README.md`. The two
seeds shipped here are drafts — plausible, not observed. The findings table is what
replaces them with earned content:

```sh
sqlite3 .project/index.db "SELECT lang, class, COUNT(*) FROM finding
                            GROUP BY lang, class ORDER BY 3 DESC;"
```

Read `docs/HANDOFF.md` before changing anything structural. It records the reasoning behind
decisions that look arbitrary from the code alone — why the index is disposable, why cycles
are withheld rather than ordered, why accelerator export redaction is structural rather
than procedural.

## Known limits

- Full reindex only; no incremental. Fine at the scale this is built for.
- `depends_on` edges are built from declared `blocked_by` frontmatter and consumed by
  `kit-plan.sh`. What does not ship is a per-stack extractor deriving them from the code
  itself, so blast radius reports **unknown, not low** — `tier-classify` treats unknown
  as at least T2.

  Co-change edges narrow this without closing it. They are derived from raw history and
  need no trailers, so a repository adopted brownfield gets *some* signal on day one — but
  measured recall@10 is 0.24, meaning roughly three quarters of genuinely related files are
  absent. They turn "unknown" into "unknown, and at least these", never into "only these",
  and `kit-index.sh` withholds the graph entirely when it measures as a hairball.
- The write guard is a net, not a security boundary. It fails open on a malformed payload,
  because a guard that blocks every edit on a parse error is a guard people remove.
- Coder and reviewer currently share a model family, so they share blind spots.
  "Independent judgment" is partly aspirational until that changes.
