# Experiment design: do cluster packs pay for themselves?

**Status: DRAFT, PRE-REGISTRATION, UNSIGNED. Nothing has been spent and nothing runs until the
operator signs §3 and §10.**

Task: `T-20260808-cluster-packs-are-generated-and-read-by-` (T2).
Kit SHA at drafting: `383432b`.
Written 2026-08-17, before any arm was run, because a design assembled after the numbers is
rationalisation. `docs/TRIAL-PROTOCOL.md` says the same thing about trials and this document
follows its rules where they apply — it is a sibling of that document, not a replacement.

**This is an experiment, not a feature.** *"Packs do not pay — stop generating them"* is a
legitimate outcome and it deletes code. §9 names exactly what gets deleted, in advance, so that
outcome cannot quietly become "inconclusive, keep it".

---

## 1. The claim, and the two rival mechanisms nobody has separated

The kit asserts a saving in two places, and they are not the same assertion.

`tooling/kit-plan.sh:305-313` claims a **cache** mechanism:

> written once per plan and byte-identical thereafter, so it belongs ABOVE the cache breakpoint
> and is served at 0.1x instead of being re-read at full price in each session.

`skills/task-context/SKILL.md:38-49` claims an **avoided-derivation** mechanism:

> the pack already named the cluster's files — do not re-derive them.

These predict *different signatures in the recorded counters*, which is the whole reason this
experiment is worth running rather than argued:

| | Mechanism | Prediction if true |
|---|---|---|
| **H1** | The pack is served from cache at 0.1× | `cache_read` share rises in the pack arm; `tok_in` roughly flat |
| **H2** | The pack replaces exploratory derivation | tool-call count and `tok_in` fall in the pack arm; cache share ~flat |
| **H0** | Neither — the pack is net cost | pack arm ≥ no-pack arm on BTE |

**H1 is doubtful as the mechanism is built, and this is a claim to test rather than one to
repeat.** The pack is read by a `Read` tool call at step 4 of the skill — that is, *inside* the
conversation, after the index refresh in step 1 and the task file in step 3, both of whose
outputs vary per task. A tool result arriving mid-conversation is below the cache breakpoint
described in `docs/HANDOFF.md` §4.6, not above it, and the prefix has already diverged before it
arrives. Byte-identity across sessions buys nothing if the bytes never sit in a shared prefix.

The skill also tells the agent to place the pack *"early and verbatim, before the task spec"* while
listing it as step **4**, after the task spec is read at step 3. Those two instructions cannot both
be followed. Recorded here as an observation, not fixed — see §12.

**The vendor's ~75% figure is not a target, a hypothesis to beat, or a number to repeat.** The
task file already says so. No arm of this experiment is sized to reproduce it.

---

## 2. Pre-flight finding: the packs on this repository are degenerate today

Reproduced 2026-08-17 on `383432b`, by rebuilding derived state and reading it. Every number
below is from a command run in that session, not from the design.

`plan_item` was **empty** and `goal` held **no rows** — while six pack files sat in
`.project/packs/default/`, orphaned from a plan that no longer existed in the index. By the
skill's own step 4 (*"No row means no plan covers this task — skip the pack"*), **not one task in
this repository could have loaded a pack**, and the files on disk would not have been consulted
by any agent following the procedure.

**The cause was found on 2026-08-17 and it is not neglect — see §2.1. `kit-index.sh` destroys the
plan every time it rebuilds, and `task-context` step 1 runs it.**

Re-running `bash tooling/kit-plan.sh` produced 11 clusters and 11 packs. What they contain:

| Observation | Value |
|---|---|
| Open tasks | 77 |
| Tasks in cluster 1 | **61 (79%)** |
| Singleton clusters | **7 of 11** |
| c1 pack size | 115 lines / 9,470 bytes (order 2.4k tokens) |
| File rows in c1's "Files this cluster touches" | 40 — the `rn <= 40` cap, against 42 distinct files, so it drops **2** |
| Open tasks with any `touches` edge | **19 of 77**, all in cluster 1 |
| Packs whose file section reads *"none recorded yet"* | **10 of 11**, covering 58 of 77 tasks |
| Findings in the index | 316 |
| Findings with `vindicated = 1` | **0** — all 316 are NULL |
| Packs with a non-empty "Confirmed defect classes" section | **0 of 11** |

Three of these are structural, not incidental:

**(a) The file list can only describe work that has already been done.** `kit-plan.sh:351` joins
`edge … rel='touches'` and nothing else. Those edges come from commit diffs carrying a `Task-Id`
(`kit-index.sh:645`), so a task with no commits has no files — and the pack is consulted precisely
when starting a task, i.e. when it has none. The kit has already met and fixed this exact gap
elsewhere: `kit-index.sh:206-213` adds frontmatter `paths:` as a second source for tier floors
because *"7 of 8 open tasks in a real backlog had no touches edges … A floor that only sees
touched files therefore passes silently on every task that has not started."* **82 of 104 task
files declare `paths:`. The pack query does not read it.**

**(b) The clustering fuses six epics into one, and the arithmetic is exact.** Cluster 1 is not a
cluster; it is `measurement` (16) + `validation` (14) + `portability` (10) + `agent-contracts` (8)
+ `accelerators` (5) + `feedback-loop` (4) + no-epic (4) = **61**. Union-find takes two signals — a
shared epic and a shared non-hub file — and it is transitive, so **one shared file between two
tasks merges both of their entire epics**. The 19 file-connected tasks span exactly those seven
groups (4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 19), and each acts as a bridge.

`cluster.hub_cap: 5` bounds only the file signal, and here it excludes exactly **one** file —
`tests/conformance.sh`, touched by 12 open tasks. Three more sit at exactly 5 (`README.md`,
`tooling/kit-index.sh`, `tooling/kit-status.sh`) and pass the `<=` test, each fusing five tasks.
Nothing bounds the epic amplification a single bridge produces.

`kit-plan.sh:131-133` records meeting this failure once already, through dependency edges — *"one
chain of 40 tasks transitively fuse every epic it passed through: 300 tasks, one cluster, no
grouping left"* — and excluding that signal for exactly this reason. The same fusion has returned
through the epic-and-file composition that replaced it.

*The 40-row cap is **not** the defect and was overstated in this document's first version: it drops
2 files of 42. The problem is that 61 tasks are in one cluster, not that its file list is
truncated.*

**(c) The third section is empty by construction here.** It requires `finding.vindicated = 1` and
this repository has never marked one. So the pack's prior-evidence section carries no evidence.

**(d) One of c1's 40 file rows names a file that cannot be opened.**
`tooling/__pycache__/kit_findings.cpython-314.pyc` is untracked and gitignored
(`.gitignore:18-19`), removed at `8704290` — *"Stop committing Python bytecode: one .pyc turned
three CI jobs red"*. The `touches` edge survives because the index is rebuilt from **full git
history** on every run and no path is ever checked against the current tree. So the stale-pack
condition of AC4 is already occurring with no rename involved, and §9's Arm C has a found instance
rather than only a synthesised one.

### 2.1 The root cause: `kit-index.sh` deletes the plan, and `task-context` step 1 runs it

Measured 2026-08-17, twice, on a clean tree:

| Action | `plan_item` | `goal` | packs on disk |
|---|---|---|---|
| after `kit-plan.sh` | 77 | 1 | 11 |
| after one plain `kit-index.sh` | **0** | **0** | 11 (orphaned) |
| `kit-index.sh --if-stale`, nothing changed | 77 | 1 | 11 |
| `touch` one task file, then `--if-stale` | **0** | **0** | 11 (orphaned) |

`kit-index.sh` rebuilds into a fresh database from `tooling/schema.sql` (`rm -f "$NEW"`, line
1195-1196). `goal` and `plan_item` are the only two tables written by a *different* tool and they
are **not derivable from text**, so a rebuild silently drops them. The word "plan" does not appear
anywhere in `kit-index.sh`; nothing warns, and the pack files it orphans stay on disk looking
current.

`skills/task-context` **step 1** is `kit-index.sh --if-stale`. **Step 4** reads `plan_item`. Any
task-file edit, event or commit makes the index stale — that is, ordinary work — so the skill's
first step deletes what its fourth step is looking for, in the same session.

This contradicts `docs/HANDOFF.md` §4.6 in terms: *"The plan is state, not context … Each task
session reads one row (~20 tokens) — and survives `/clear`, session end, or a crash."* It survives
all three. It does not survive the next session's first step.

**It is also the most likely explanation for `docs/MEASUREMENTS.md` §F** — *"13 cluster packs
generated, read by nothing"*. Not that nobody followed the skill: that by the time anyone did,
there was no plan row to find.

### What this does to the experiment

Running an A/B today measures **a 2.4k-token list of 61 task titles plus 40 filenames** against
**nothing**. That is a real measurement of the artifact as it exists, and it is not a measurement
of the idea. A "does not pay" result from it would be true of this implementation and would tell
us nothing about whether a pack that named 5 relevant files and 3 confirmed defect classes would
pay — which is the thing the design claims.

Reporting the degenerate result as *"cluster packs do not pay"* would be the same error the kit
has already documented twice: a green-but-meaningless check, and a summary that upgrades a narrow
result into a broad one.

---

## 3. The decision the operator makes before anything is spent

**§2.1 is a blocker, not a route option. Arm A cannot exist until it is fixed.** Arm A needs a
`plan_item` row to survive from setup to step 4, and `task-context` step 1 deletes it in the same
session. Run today, **Arm A silently degrades into Arm B** and the experiment reports a null
result it was guaranteed to report. Fixing the plan's survival is a precondition of every route
below except R3.

Three routes. They differ in cost and in what the answer means.

| | Route | Spend | What a result means |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R1** | **Fix the pack, then measure.** Land plan survival (§2.1) ✅, then **clustering**, then the `paths:` fallback; re-plan; then run §4. **Order corrected 2026-08-18 — see below.** | Fix work (unestimated) + §10 budget | Tests the *idea*. The strongest answer, and the slowest. |
| **R2** | **Measure as-is, knowingly.** Fix §2.1 only — the minimum that makes Arm A distinguishable from Arm B — then run §4 on today's packs and scope the claim to this implementation. | §2.1 fix + §10 budget | Tests *this artifact*. Cheap, honest, and cannot license the general claim. |
| **R3** | **Stop and delete now.** Treat §2 as sufficient: the mechanism has been unreachable in ordinary use since it was built, its file list is empty where it matters, and its evidence section has never been non-empty. | ~zero | Saves the whole budget. Forfeits the measurement the task asked for. |

### R1's internal order was wrong, and so was the reason given for it (corrected 2026-08-18)

Two errors, both mine, both found by re-deriving a claim this document had been repeating.

**1. The `paths:` fallback was called a blocker on the grounds that the experiment would have no
population. That is false.** §5 draws pairs from cluster 1, `open`, T1–T2, no `blocked_by` — a
population of **35 tasks today**, against Stage 1's 6 pairs and Stage 2's 3. There was never a
shortage. The claim came from re-reading §2(a)'s "58 of 77 tasks can never receive a pack with
file information" and carrying it into a context where it does not apply: the experiment reads the
**cluster's** pack, and cluster 1's pack carries 40 file rows. §5's restriction to cluster 1 was
chosen for exactly that reason and already sidesteps the gap.

**2. Doing `paths:` before the clustering fix would make the artifact worse.** Measured
2026-08-18, against the same figures §2 recorded on 2026-08-17:

| | at §2 | now |
|---|---|---|
| tasks in cluster 1 | 61 of 77 | **70 of 83** |
| distinct files cluster 1 touches | 42 | **47** |
| rows the pack prints | 40 (cap) | 40 (cap) |

The cap now truncates **7** files rather than 2, and the degeneracy grew simply because tasks were
filed. `paths:` adds *more* files to that list. Landing it first enlarges the file section of an
already-degenerate 70-task cluster and pushes further past a cap that is silently binding — so the
`paths:` fix would be measured against a baseline worse than today's.

**Corrected order inside R1:** plan survival ✅ → **clustering**
(`T-20260817-one-shared-file-merges-two-whole-epics-s`) → `paths:`
(`T-20260817-a-cluster-pack-file-list-ignores-declare`) → re-plan → §4.

The clustering task is now a declared `blocked_by` on this experiment's task, so the ordering
lives in the backlog rather than only in this paragraph — which is what let the wrong order
survive three retellings.

**Recommendation: R1, restricted to cluster 1.** §2.1 has to be fixed for any measurement to mean
anything, and §2(a) is a one-source-to-two-source change the kit has already made once in
`kit-index.sh`; without it, 58 of 77 tasks can never receive a pack carrying any file information
and the experiment has no population.

**§2.1 also strengthens the case for R3, and that should be said plainly.** A mechanism that has
disabled itself on every ordinary session since it was written has no usage evidence behind it at
all, and the honest reading is that nothing has ever depended on it. R3 remains not-recommended
only because the faults found are all in the pack's *derivation* — deleting on this evidence
punishes the implementation for a premise that has still never been tested.

**If R2 is chosen, the report title is fixed in advance:** *"the cluster pack as generated on
2026-08-17 does/does not pay"* — never *"cluster packs do/do not pay"*.

---

## 4. The arms, pre-registered

### Design: paired, within-task

The acceptance criterion as written asks for *"two tasks in one cluster, one arm with the pack and
one without"*. **That design confounds the arm with the task** — a difference of 30% between two
different tasks is not evidence about packs, because two tasks never cost the same. Proposed
amendment, for sign-off: **the same task, run in both arms, in separate copies, from the same
commit.** Task difficulty is then held exactly constant and the pair difference is attributable.
n is the number of *pairs*, and it is stated on every figure.

Sessions do not share state, so the second run is not contaminated by the first; each arm gets its
own `git clone --no-hardlinks` copy verified with `kit-preflight.sh --isolated`.

### The three arms

| Arm | Setup | What it isolates |
|---|---|---|
| **A — pack** | `kit-plan.sh` run in the copy; `plan_item` row exists; pack on disk | the mechanism as intended |
| **B — no plan** | `kit-plan.sh` **not run**; no `plan_item` row, no pack directory | the control |
| **C — stale pack** | plan generated, then files renamed/deleted in the copy so the pack names paths that no longer exist | AC4: is a confident wrong pack worse than none |

**Arm B is defined as "no plan", not "pack file deleted".** Deleting the file leaves a `plan_item`
row pointing at a missing path, which is a *third* condition (a broken pack) and not the control.
With no plan the skill takes its own documented branch — *"No row means no plan covers this task —
skip the pack"* — so the only difference between A and B is that a plan exists.

**Checked, and it constrains the protocol:** `plan_item` is read by exactly two consumers —
`skills/task-context` step 4, and `kit-plan.sh`'s own `--show`/`--next`. So the arms differ only
in the pack, **provided the task id is given to the agent explicitly**. Never let an arm choose its
own work with `--next`; that would reintroduce the plan as a second variable.

### Stage 1 and Stage 2 — a budget gate, not two experiments

**Stage 1 (cheap): context assembly only.** Each run invokes only the `task-context` skill and
stops, reporting the files it loaded. This isolates precisely what the pack is supposed to change —
derivation cost — at a fraction of a full task. It separates H1 from H2 (§1) on the counters, and
it is the only stage needed to answer *"is there a delta worth chasing?"*.

**Stage 2 (expensive): the full task, arms A and B, with review.** Required for the quality
criterion — a cheaper assembly that omitted the right file shows up nowhere in Stage 1. Stage 2
runs **only if** Stage 1 clears the threshold in §9, and that threshold is fixed now.

---

## 5. The subject

**A `--no-hardlinks` clone of this repository, per arm, per pair.**

Justified: it has 104 tasks, real history, a populated co-change graph, and 19 tasks carrying
`touches` edges — the only population where a pack has any file content at all. A fresh subject
would have to be adopted, tiered and planned first, which is a trial (`TRIAL-PROTOCOL.md`), not
this experiment.

**Stated bound, to appear in the report:** the kit's own backlog has unusually well-formed task
files. Packs will look *better* here than on an arbitrary brownfield repo, and no figure from this
experiment may be quoted as a rate for one.

**The precondition that is not negotiable:** every run goes through
`claude --plugin-dir <kit> …` against the copy. The kit's hooks fire only when it is loaded as a
plugin; a run from a development session records `scope=main` rows that conflate every agent, and
the experiment would produce a confident wrong number. This was established 2026-08-16 by a probe
that recorded `scope=subagent`, `agent=general-purpose`, 42,491 BTE for one trivial subagent.

**Task selection, pre-registered:** pairs are drawn from **cluster 1 only** (the only cluster whose
pack carries files), from tasks that are `open`, tiered T1–T2, and have no `blocked_by`. The
specific ids are written into this file before the first run and not changed afterwards.

---

## 6. The unit and the instruments

**BTE, exactly as `TRIAL-PROTOCOL.md` §1 defines it**, weights read from their single home
(`BTE=` in `tooling/kit-status.sh`) and never retyped. Per-agent figures come from that section's
query against the `spend` table. Raw counters are recorded alongside every weighted total, because
weights are a pricing assumption and a weighted total cannot be un-weighted.

**Do not use the harness's per-agent completion summary.** It is final context size, not cost —
reconciled at 0.012% against summed last-context while differing from output work by 5–215×.

Pre-flight, per §0 of the trial protocol and for the same reasons:

- [ ] `bash tooling/kit-preflight.sh --spend` passes **in the copy**, after one throwaway agent.
- [ ] `bash tooling/kit-preflight.sh --isolated <copy>` returns zero for every copy.
- [ ] `git status --short` clean before each `kit-index.sh`, or the index read is early.
- [ ] `kit-index.sh` and `kit-status.sh` run clean in the copy.

**The criticals pre-flight (`--criticals`) is not a gate on this experiment** and saying so here is
deliberate: it gates *trials on someone else's codebase*. This runs on a copy of our own repo with
no remote. If the operator wants it applied anyway, that is a sign-off decision, and today it would
block — 17 unfixed criticals, nine of them awaiting the `--unassessable` marks.

---

## 7. AC1 — proving the pack was actually read

*"The skill says to read it"* is not evidence. Three independent checks, all required:

1. **Transcript tool-use.** The session transcript must contain a `Read` `tool_use` whose path is
   the pack. `kit-spend.sh --transcript` already locates transcripts; the check is a grep for the
   pack path in a `tool_use` block, not in prose.
2. **Negative control.** Arm B's transcript must contain **no** read of any path under
   `.project/packs/`. An arm that reads a pack it was not given voids that pair.
3. **Downstream use.** The agent's own report names files, and in Arm A those names must be
   traceable to the pack rather than to a fresh `sqlite3` or `grep`. Recorded by comparing the
   report's file list against the pack's, and against the tool log for independent derivation of
   the same names.

Check 3 is the one that distinguishes *read* from *used*, and it is the one most likely to fail.
If it does, that is a finding about the skill, not a void pair.

---

## 8. AC3 — the quality side, and the trap in measuring it

The claim is that a pack removes repeated derivation **without** removing depth. A cheaper arm that
finds less has disproved the claim, not supported it.

**The trap:** scoring "did the agent touch the right files" against the pack's own file list scores
Arm A against its own answer key. That measures compliance, not correctness.

**Ground truth is sealed before the runs.** For each selected task the operator writes the files the
acceptance criteria actually require, into a file committed **before** the first arm runs. Both arms
are scored against that list — precision and recall of files loaded, and of files changed.

**Review is blind to arm.** In Stage 2 the reviewer receives the diff and the task file only, with
no indication of which arm produced it, and its findings are recorded through
`kit-review-record.sh` so that "found nothing" and "recorded nothing" stay distinguishable
(`finding-gap` rows with reasons are part of the result).

Recorded per arm: verdict, finding count by severity and class, findings rejected by the recorder,
and files loaded / changed against the sealed list.

---

## 9. AC4 — the stale arm, and what counts as an answer

Arm C exists because a pack that names files which have moved is a *confident wrong answer*, and
the design has no staleness detection: the pack is a snapshot, deliberately frozen, regenerated
only on the next `kit-plan.sh` run.

Staleness is introduced mechanically in the copy — rename two files the pack names, delete one —
and the question is behavioural, not numeric:

- Does the agent notice the paths do not exist, or does it report on files it never opened?
- Does it fall back to deriving, or does it stop?
- Does the wrongness reach the diff?

**Pre-registered:** if any Arm C run produces a report naming a file it could not have read, that
is recorded as a **critical** finding against the pack mechanism regardless of what Arms A and B
show on cost. A cheaper mechanism that lies is not cheaper.

---

## 10. The decision rule, fixed in advance

n will be small. **No p-values, no significance claims** — the rule is about effect size and
direction consistency, and the n appears next to every figure.

**Stage 1 gate (assembly only, n = 6 pairs proposed):**

| Result | Action |
|---|---|
| Arm A cheaper in **≥ 5 of 6** pairs **and** median BTE reduction **≥ 20%** | proceed to Stage 2 |
| Median reduction **< 10%**, or Arm A cheaper in ≤ 3 of 6 | **stop. Packs do not pay.** Go to §11 |
| Anything between | report as **inconclusive at n=6**, and stop. Do not re-run opportunistically to chase the band |

**Stage 2 verdict (full task, n = 3 pairs proposed):**

- **Packs pay** — Stage 1 gate cleared **and** no quality regression: recall against the sealed
  list not lower in Arm A, and no severity class present in B and absent in A.
- **Packs do not pay** — any quality regression, or Stage 1's reduction not reproduced.
- **Packs are dangerous** — any Arm C run per §9, which overrides both of the above.

The 20% / 10% thresholds are a judgement, chosen so the answer has to be large enough to survive
being wrong about the subject. They are stated here to be argued with **before** the data exists.
Changing them after a run voids the experiment.

---

## 11. If packs do not pay — what gets deleted

Named now so the outcome cannot decay into "keep it, it's already written":

- `tooling/kit-plan.sh:305-391` — the whole pack block, its `sq()` helper, the sqlite ≥ 3.25
  requirement and both warnings.
- `skills/task-context/SKILL.md` step 4, and step 7's *"The pack already named the cluster's
  files"*.
- `tooling/kit-init.sh:84-86` — the `.gitignore` entry.
- The sqlite 3.25 line in `INSTALL.md` and `README.md:202-203`, if nothing else needs window
  functions.
- `docs/DESIGN-NOTES.md:185`, which names cluster packs as rebuildable derived state.

`docs/HANDOFF.md` §4.6 needs **no** change: its claim is about `plan_item` as state (*"each task
session reads one row (~20 tokens)"*), which survives pack deletion intact.

Clustering itself is **not** deleted — `plan_item.cluster` orders the plan independently of whether
a pack file is written. Only the artifact goes.

---

## 12. VOID conditions specific to this experiment

Beyond `TRIAL-PROTOCOL.md` §3, which applies unchanged:

| Condition | Detection |
|---|---|
| An arm ran outside `--plugin-dir`, so only `scope=main` rows exist | `SELECT DISTINCT scope FROM spend` in the copy must contain `subagent` |
| Arm B read a pack | grep its transcript for `.project/packs/` (§7 check 2) |
| The two arms of a pair started from different commits | record `git rev-parse HEAD` per arm; they must match |
| The pack changed between the arms of a pair | `sha256` the pack before and after Arm A |
| Two tasks in flight in one copy | spend attribution binds a transcript to the following transition and can bind to the wrong task. One task at a time, per `TRIAL-PROTOCOL.md` §5 |
| The plan was regenerated mid-pair | `plan_item` row count and cluster id recorded per arm; must match |
| **Arm A lost its plan mid-session and silently became Arm B** (§2.1) | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM plan_item` in the copy **after** the run, not only before. Zero voids the pair — and §7 check 1 must independently show the pack was read |

---

## 13. What this experiment cannot establish

- **Whether packs help on a repository unlike this one.** §5 states the bound; the report repeats it.
- **Whether a *well-formed* pack pays, if R2 is chosen.** Only R1 tests the idea.
- **Whether H1 would hold if the pack were placed above the cache breakpoint.** That is a different
  build, not a different arm. If the counters say H2 and not H1, the honest conclusion is that the
  saving is avoided derivation and the `kit-plan.sh:308` comment is wrong — worth a separate task.
- **Anything about accumulation over a long-running plan.** Every pair here is one session.

---

## 14. Companion: the R-13 documentation-layer audit

Folded into the same task and answered separately, because it needs no agents and almost no spend.

`docs/HANDOFF.md` §4.7 already carries a measurement — ~1,259 tokens always-on (5 skills ~440,
8 subagent descriptions ~840, hooks zero, MCP zero), taken with
`claude --plugin-dir . plugin details coding-kit`. The audit is therefore: **re-run that command at
`383432b`, confirm the figure still holds, and check each always-loaded item against the rule the
register asked for** — anything always-loaded that does not earn its place moves to on-demand.

This is independent of §3's route and can run first at negligible cost. It is *not* a substitute
for the experiment: it measures the resident footprint, not what the pack buys.

---

## 15. Acceptance-criteria coverage

| AC (from the task file) | Where | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — a pack is loaded by a real agent, observably | §7 | three checks, one of which distinguishes read from used |
| 2 — both arms in BTE, n stated | §4, §6, §10 | **amended**: paired within-task, not two different tasks. Needs sign-off |
| 3 — quality, not only tokens | §8 | sealed ground truth; blind review |
| 4 — what happens when the pack is stale | §9 | promoted to a full arm with an overriding verdict |
| 5 — if they do not pay, stop generating them | §10, §11 | deletion list written before the data exists |

---

## 16. Sign-off checklist

- [ ] **§3 route chosen** — R1 (fix first), R2 (measure as-is), or R3 (stop and delete).
- [ ] **§4 amendment accepted or rejected** — paired within-task instead of two tasks.
- [ ] **§10 thresholds accepted or changed** — 20% / 10%, ≥5 of 6, before any data exists.
- [ ] **Budget accepted.** Order-of-magnitude, and it is large: the only measured task in this
      repository's `spend` table cost **10,142k BTE** (n=1, 11 transcripts, main scope). Stage 1 is
      a small fraction of a task and 12 runs should land in single-digit millions; **Stage 2 at 3
      pairs × 2 arms plus blind reviews plausibly costs 60M+ BTE**. Stage 1's gate exists to avoid
      paying that for nothing. A cap should be stated here before signing.
- [ ] **Time-box stated**, in hours.
- [ ] **Task ids for the pairs written into §5** and frozen.
- [ ] **Sealed ground-truth file committed** (§8) before the first arm runs.

Nothing in this document has been executed. The first thing it will discover is that this document
is wrong somewhere — `TRIAL-PROTOCOL.md` was reviewed three times before its first checkbox proved
unevaluable, and the fix for that was running it, not reviewing it again.
