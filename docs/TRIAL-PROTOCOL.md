# Trial protocol

How to run the kit against a project it has never seen, so that two trials can be compared.

**This is a procedure, not a report.** You should be able to execute it without having read
`docs/MEASUREMENTS.md`. That document is the first trial's *results*, and it is cited here only
where a rule exists because something went wrong there.

The procedure is fixed **before** a trial, not reconstructed after it. A comparison assembled
afterwards from whatever each run happened to record is not a comparison.

**Revision 2, 2026-08-12.** Revision 1 was reviewed before first use and rejected with two
criticals — its isolation rule left `git push` pointed at the subject, and it mandated a figure
the kit does not emit while forbidding the only way to get it. Both are fixed below. The review
is the reason this document is usable, and the reason to run one again after the first trial.

---

## 0. Pre-flight

Stop unless every box is ticked. Record the answers; they are part of the result.

**The kit**

- [ ] Working tree clean, full conformance green, CI green on every platform.
- [ ] No unfixed critical anywhere in the backlog. **Computable — run it, do not judge it:**

          bash tooling/kit-preflight.sh --criticals

      **The rule is not written here.** It lived in this document AND in `kit-status.sh`, and a
      rule with two homes has been wrong twice: once filtering by task state, once excluding
      refutations too eagerly. The command is the single home; this box calls it.

      **Not filtered by task state.** An earlier revision read `AND t.state='progress'`, so a
      critical on a *done* task did not count — closing the task cleared the pre-flight exactly
      as well as fixing the defect, and two of this repository's own outstanding criticals were
      invisible to it. A gate you can satisfy by editing a status field is not a gate.

      **Refuted findings are excluded only when the refutation is unambiguous.**
      `kit-vindicate.sh` keys on `(task, class)` and marks every finding matching both, so on a
      task with two `fail-open` findings one `--false` about the harmless one also refutes the
      critical. It is retired only when it is the sole finding of its class on its task;
      otherwise it stays in the gate, unjudged rather than assumed innocent.

      Zero, or stop. `kit-status.sh` prints the same thing per task under **Outstanding
      criticals**, and `kit-resolve.sh --list --severity critical --unfixed` names them.
      An unmarked finding counts as OUTSTANDING: silence is not a fix.
- [ ] **The third state: unassessable criticals. Run it, and record the number.**

          bash tooling/kit-preflight.sh --unassessable

      **A zero from the box above does not mean there is nothing wrong.** `--criticals`
      deliberately excludes any finding the operator marked `--unassessable`, because those
      cannot be judged from what survives and leaving them in would make the gate permanently
      unsatisfiable — no trial could ever run. The cost is that a repository whose every
      remaining critical is unassessable reports **zero and passes**, with the blind spot
      intact. That is the state this box exists to make visible, and it is the exact shape the
      whole criticals chain was built to remove: **a pre-flight box that a third state silently
      satisfies.**
- [ ] **The fourth state: superseded criticals. Run it, and record the number.**

          bash tooling/kit-preflight.sh --superseded

      Same hole, one category over, and it opened the day the fourth disposition landed —
      `--criticals` excludes `superseded_at` too, so a repository whose every remaining critical
      criticised a withdrawn design reports **zero** and passes with nothing said. This
      repository was in precisely that state within minutes of the verb existing: the gate went
      to zero with **thirteen** excluded criticals behind it, nine unassessable and four
      superseded.

      **It is not the same blind spot and the two counts are not summed.** An unassessable
      critical is unreadable — nobody can say what it was, and that is a gap in the record. A
      superseded one is perfectly readable, **was real, and its subject was withdrawn, often
      because of it.** One is missing evidence; the other is evidence that did its job. Reporting
      them as one number would erase the most valuable thing a review produces.

      Non-zero is not a stop. It is a **figure the trial report carries**, next to the
      unassessable count, so "no unfixed critical outstanding" is read as what it is.

      **This is NOT a stop by itself.** An unassessable critical is a standing blind spot, not
      an unaddressed defect, and treating it as a stop would restore the unsatisfiable gate.
      Proceed — with the count recorded in §7's report, next to the kit SHA, where a reader
      comparing two trials can see it. A trial run over a known blind spot is a valid trial that
      says so; a trial run over one it never mentioned is not.

      **Three things that ARE stops**, and they are judgement rather than exit codes:

      1. **An unassessable critical on a task this trial will exercise.** The blind spot is then
         inside the path being measured, and any finding the trial produces there cannot be told
         from the one nobody could judge. Check the `task_id` column the command prints against
         the trial's scope.
      2. **The count went UP since the last trial.** These are meant to be a bounded historical
         set — findings that predate the summary column. A new one means something is producing
         unjudgeable findings *now*, which is a recording-discipline failure and a worse problem
         than the nine. Compare against the previous report; §6 requires both to carry it.
      3. **Any of them carries no reason.** `--reason` is required by `kit-resolve.sh` precisely
         because a mark that clears a gate without saying why is the laundering the gate exists
         to prevent. If the command prints `(no reason recorded)`, the record was written around
         the tool and the mark cannot be trusted.

- [ ] `git rev-parse HEAD` recorded. The SHA is the kit version, not the tag.

**The instruments** — an unmeasured trial is worse than none, because it looks like a result.

- [ ] **Spend capture is live.** Run one throwaway agent, then:

          bash tooling/kit-preflight.sh --spend

      A failure here means **the entire cost half of the trial will be empty**. Not
      hypothetical: this repository recorded **0 spend rows across 12 days** of heavy use, and
      `kit-status.sh` skips the cost section silently when the table is empty, so nothing
      announced it.

      > This box used to read `sqlite3 .project/index.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM spend;"` with no
      > rebuild, which made it **say STOP to a working kit**. Hooks append to

      > faults they are.
- [ ] **Findings capture is live.** Run one reviewer through `kit-review-record.sh` and confirm
      a row lands. A review that records nothing is indistinguishable from a review that found
      nothing (§3).
- [ ] `kit-index.sh` and `kit-status.sh` both run clean on the copy.

**The subject**

- [ ] **The subject copy has NO REMOTE.** Not "a copy or a clone with its remote removed" —
      that phrasing was the hole. A `cp -r` copy carries `.git/config` verbatim, so it keeps
      `origin` pointed at the subject, and §4's removal procedure began with `git clone` and so
      covered only the other path. The rule is a property of the copy, not of how you made it,
      and it is checked the same way either way:

          bash tooling/kit-preflight.sh --isolated <copy>

      Zero, or stop. §4 has the reasoning and the same check.
- [ ] **Baseline recorded before the kit touches anything**: does the subject build, do its
      tests pass, how long do they take. A subject whose tests already fail is a valid trial
      subject, but only if you knew that first — otherwise the kit gets blamed for it.
- [ ] The subject's owner has agreed, if that is not you.

**The trial**

- [ ] **The question is written down.** "Try the kit on X" is not a question. "Does the
      co-change graph produce a usable ordering on a repo with four years of history" is.
- [ ] **Time-box stated**, in hours, before starting.
- [ ] **Stop rules stated.** Stop and record what you have when: the time-box expires; the same
      kit defect blocks progress three times; or any VOID condition (§3) is hit.
- [ ] **Abort path stated.** If the kit crashes or corrupts state mid-trial, the trial is
      recorded as aborted at that point with the cause — it is never silently restarted, because
      a restarted trial has a contaminated index and is no longer comparable.

## 1. The unit

**Billing-weighted input-token-equivalents (BTE).** One number, four counters:

    input×1 + cache-write×1.25 + cache-read×0.1 + output×5

**Never retype those weights.** They have one home — `BTE=` in `tooling/kit-status.sh` — and a
conformance step asserts this document still agrees with it. Read them from that home:

```sh
W=$(sed -n 's/^BTE="(\(.*\))"/\1/p' tooling/kit-status.sh)
```

**What the kit emits, and what it does not.** `kit-status.sh` reports BTE grouped by **tier,
scope, provenance and model**. It does **not** emit a per-agent figure. Revision 1 mandated
per-agent BTE anyway, which made two of its own rules jointly unsatisfiable. The `spend` table
does carry an `agent` column, so the number is one query away — and this form takes the weights
from their one home rather than duplicating them:

```sh
sqlite3 -column .project/index.db "
  SELECT COALESCE(NULLIF(s.agent,''),'(main loop)') AS agent,
         COUNT(*) AS transcripts, SUM($W)/100000 AS kBTE
    FROM spend s GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 3 DESC;"
```

**Where the counters come from.** `kit-spend.sh` writes them from the `SubagentStop` and `Stop`
hooks — nobody types it, which is why §0 checks the hooks are live rather than trusting them.
Its `--transcript` flag is the manual door if you are reconstructing a run after the fact.

**Do NOT use the harness's per-agent completion summary.**
That figure is each agent's **final context size**, not its cost.
Reconciled across a 105-subagent run it matched summed last-context to 0.012% while differing
from actual output work by **5–215×**. It is a fair measure of context carried and a worthless
measure of money. The first trial's headline table is in that wrong unit and says so; do not
reproduce the mistake by copying its shape.

**Record raw counters alongside the weighted total.** Weights are a pricing assumption and
pricing changes; raw counters can be re-weighted later, a weighted total cannot be undone.

---

## 2. Constant, varied, recorded

### Constant WITHIN a trial

Changing any of these mid-trial voids it: the kit SHA, the agent set and each agent's
capability, the profile (`tier.rule`, `commands.*`, `ingest.*`, `accelerator.*`), and whether
accelerators are loaded.

`commands.*` and `tier.rule` must be **authored per subject** — a Rust monorepo has different
test commands from a TypeScript one. Author them during pre-flight, record them verbatim in the
report, and do not touch them again once the trial starts.

### Constant ACROSS trials — the part that makes comparison legitimate

This is the section revision 1 was missing entirely, and without it the document fixed a
procedure that produced incomparable results.

| Must match across compared trials | Why |
|---|---|
| the BTE definition | a different unit is a different measurement |
| the agent set and capabilities | the cost question is about these agents |
| the tier vocabulary and floors' *shape* | floors differ per subject; the ladder must not |
| what counts as an escape | the escape rate is otherwise not one number |
| the report template (§7) | a figure not in both reports cannot be compared |

**The kit SHA will differ between trials, and that is unavoidable** — §7 requires filing and
fixing the defects each trial finds. So "vary one thing per trial" is false as stated, and
revision 1 stated it. The honest rule: **the subject is the variable; the kit moves anyway.**
Record both SHAs and diff them, and when a figure moves, say plainly that either the subject or
the kit could account for it. A two-trial difference is a hypothesis, not a finding.

#### WALL-CLOCK IS NOT COMPARABLE ACROSS MACHINES, and on this one it is not a measurement of the kit

Record the **machine's process-creation latency** beside any wall-clock figure, because on the
development machine it dominates everything else. Measured 2026-08-22:

    $sw=[Diagnostics.Stopwatch]::StartNew()
    for($i=0;$i -lt 50;$i++){ Start-Process cmd.exe -ArgumentList '/c','exit' -NoNewWindow -Wait }
    $sw.Stop(); "{0:N0} ms per spawn" -f ($sw.Elapsed.TotalMilliseconds/50)

**1,015 ms per process creation.** A healthy machine is 10–30 ms. The consequence is arithmetic
rather than opinion: a minimal three-task fixture costs ~61 spawns and takes **25 seconds** to
index, the suite performs **90 index builds**, and that is essentially its entire runtime — about
an hour locally against **43 seconds** for the same suite on ubuntu in CI.

**It does not parallelise.** 160 spawns took 65 s sequentially and 56 s across eight concurrent
workers — 1.16×, not 8×, on sixteen idle cores, with `sys` time *rising*. Process creation is
serialised at roughly 2.5/sec however many ask, so neither `xargs -P` nor more cores helps.

**Four causes were tested and refuted**, each by measurement rather than argument:

| hypothesis | result |
|---|---|
| Defender path exclusions | 80 s vs 79 s |
| Overwolf process hooks | 76 s vs 79 s |
| msys `fork` emulation | PowerShell → `cmd.exe` is *slower* still |
| Defender real-time protection **off** | **1,016 ms vs 1,015 ms** |

`fltmc filters` lists only Microsoft drivers — no third-party endpoint, backup or sync filter.
The cause is unidentified and is tracked as its own task.

**What this means for a trial report.** Any duration measured on that machine describes the
machine, not the kit. State the spawn latency beside it, or report API time and token counts and
mark wall-clock UNAVAILABLE — the same honesty §7 requires of a missing cost figure. Two trials
run on different machines cannot have their wall-clock compared at all, and the fd trial's
"six seconds" for co-change was measured before any of this was known.

### Record every time

| | |
|---|---|
| kit commit SHA | the exact tree that ran, both trials when comparing |
| subject | language mix, size, commit count, age of history |
| greenfield or brownfield | and whether history was truncated |
| BTE by tier / scope / provenance / model | what `kit-status.sh` emits |
| BTE by agent | the query in §1 |
| raw counters | so the weighting can be redone |
| verdict per reviewer | and whether a second was genuinely blind (§3) |
| findings per agent | class, severity, summary, via `kit-review-record.sh` |
| findings **rejected** by the recorder | the `finding-gap` rows, with reasons |
| escape rate by tier | over both provenance populations |
| wall-clock and API time | separately |
| **n** | on every figure, in the figure |

**Tool-use counts are not currently obtainable.** Revision 1 asked for them and asserted a
five-use threshold, and no tool in the kit counts tool uses. If your harness reports them,
record them and say which harness; otherwise record that they were unavailable rather than
leaving a column that looks unmeasured.

---

## 3. What makes a trial VOID — and how to detect each

Each of these produced a wrong answer on a real run. A trial that hits one is not a weak
result — it is **no result**. Revision 1 stated the conditions without saying how to notice
them, which made three of five undetectable in practice.

| Condition | Detection you can actually run |
|---|---|
| **A worktree path in a prompt does not isolate a subagent.** Both agents in one comparison found and read the live repository; one said so and reviewed that instead. | Grep the agent's own reply and tool log for paths outside the worktree root. If the harness does not expose a tool log, a blind comparison cannot be validated — say so and do not claim one. |
| **Registering a finding contaminates every later blind run.** | `sqlite3 … "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM finding WHERE at < '<worktree commit date>'"` — the worktree must predate every row you are hiding. |
| **Reindexing before committing** showed `T2 0/8` and nearly produced a report that the escape mechanism was broken. | Run `git status --short` before `kit-index.sh`; a non-empty tree means the index you are about to read is early. |
| **A permission denial inside a subagent degrades into a partial read.** | Check the tool log for denials. An agent that discloses one is salvageable; assume an undisclosed denial happened if its tool count is far below its peers on the same task. |
| **A reviewer that returns nothing may not have reviewed nothing.** An empty `{"findings":[]}` records as `reason=empty` — *"looked and found nothing"*. | `sqlite3 .project/index.db "SELECT json_extract(payload,'$.reason') AS reason, COUNT(*) FROM event WHERE kind='finding-gap' GROUP BY 1"`. Any `rejected` row is a review whose findings were lost. Confirm the reviewer received a prompt before believing any zero. |

**The last detection was itself undetectable, and that is a fourth instance of this section's
own failure.** It read `SELECT reason, COUNT(*) FROM … kind='finding-gap'`, with a literal
ellipsis where the table and `WHERE` belong — the row above it elides only the database path, so
the shape read as complete. Nobody could run it. Completing it the obvious way then fails:
`reason` is **not a column**, it lives inside `payload`, and `FROM event` returns
`Parse error: no such column: reason`. So the one check that catches a **lost review** has never
been runnable, in a section whose whole premise is that a condition without a detection is not a
control. Corrected above and verified against this repository: it returns `empty|2` here — two
gaps, both `empty`, **no `rejected` rows**, so no review has in fact been lost to date.

**A VOID trial is still recorded** — as `docs/TRIALS/<date>-<subject>-VOID.md`, naming the
condition hit and what had been established before it. Discarding it silently is the same
failure as an unrecorded empty review: the next person repeats it.

---

## 4. Isolation — what a trial must not do to the subject

The subject projects are real work. The operator's condition, and it decides the method rather
than qualifying it: **do not destabilise them.**

**The copy must have no path back.** Revision 1 said "a copy or a read-only clone" and was
rejected on it: `git clone` leaves `origin` pointing at the subject, and `git push` is a **Bash**
invocation, which the guard hook does not match (below). Do this instead:

```sh
git clone --no-hardlinks <subject> <copy>
cd <copy>
git remote remove origin
```

`--no-hardlinks` because a hardlinked object store shares files with the subject.

**Then verify the PROPERTY, not the procedure.** Revision 2 fixed the clone path and left the
copy path open: the removal block above starts with `git clone`, while §0 still permitted "a
COPY", and `cp -r` duplicates `.git/config` with `origin` intact. A rule about how you made the
copy cannot be checked afterwards; a rule about what is true of it can. One command, whichever
route you took:

```sh
bash tooling/kit-preflight.sh --isolated <copy>
```

It exits non-zero if the copy has any remote, is not a git repository at all, or still shares an
object store with the subject via `alternates` — the hardlink case wearing a different hat. Run
it after making the copy and before any agent runs. **That command is the control; the intention
is not.**

**What is enforced and what is not.** `hooks/hooks.json` matches `Write|Edit|NotebookEdit`, so
the guard blocks those outside the project root. **It does not see Bash at all** — no `git push`,
no `rm`, no redirect. So non-destructiveness is a procedure *you* enforce; the removed remote is
what makes the procedure hold when the guard cannot.

**Hooks go in the copy, never the subject.** Revision 1 banned hooks in the subject while
requiring every metric that `kit-init.sh` produces, and `kit-init.sh` installs `commit-msg` and
`pre-push` and edits `.gitignore` — so the document forbade what it required. The resolution is
that **the copy is not the subject**: run `kit-init.sh` there and let it install whatever it
installs. Nothing is ever installed into the subject.

**Everything the trial produces for the subject is a proposal** — files for review, never
applied, never pushed.

---

## 5. Attribution

A trial that cannot separate kit work from other work produces numbers nobody can interpret
later.

- Every task the trial touches carries `kit`, `agent`, `manual`, or `unknown`.
- **`unknown` is the honest default** for pre-existing work and is load-bearing on brownfield,
  where most of the backlog predates adoption. Recording it is not a failure; guessing is.
- **Back-fill uses the lowercase `via:` frontmatter key.** `Via:` is the git trailer and a
  commit already written cannot gain one.
- **Precedence: a `Via:` trailer beats the frontmatter `via:`.** The derivation takes the last
  `via` event by sequence and falls back to frontmatter only when there is none — so a
  back-filled value is silently overridden by any later trailer on that task. If you back-fill
  and then commit against the same task, state which value you intended.
- Provenance is set by the operator, never by the agent that did the work.
- **Run one task at a time.** Spend attribution binds a transcript to the task whose transition
  follows it; with two tasks in flight it can bind to the wrong one, and the resulting cost
  figures are wrong in a way nothing detects afterwards.
- Report escape rate over **both** populations. If `via:kit` has no denominator, the report says
  so — zeroes shaped like a rate are not a result.

---

## 6. Reporting

**State n on every figure**, next to the number, not in a preamble. A figure whose n is
elsewhere gets quoted without it.

**Never generalise across subjects without saying so.** One greenfield TypeScript run is not a
rate card for a polyglot Rust monorepo.

**Every number in the report needs a source.** Revision 1 asserted a five-tool-use threshold and
a "4× divergence" between wall-clock and API time, neither with a derivation or an n — breaking
this document's own rule three sections later. If a number came from one session, say so and
give the n; if it came from nowhere, delete it.

**Report what was NOT exercised.** The first trial's most useful section lists what it never
touched. An untested component named as untested is information; one omitted reads as fine.

**Carry the unassessable count, and the previous trial's, in the header.** Both, side by side —
the number alone says how large the blind spot is, and only the pair says whether it is growing.
§0's third stop condition is unevaluable without the previous figure, so a report that omits it
disarms a control in the *next* trial rather than its own.

**Separate three kinds of finding**, because they have different lifetimes:

1. defects **in the kit** → tasks here
2. defects **in the subject** → the subject owner's, delivered as a proposal
3. **methodology** failures → §3 of this document

**Disputed findings.** Where the subject's owner disagrees that a finding is real, record it as
disputed with both positions and do not resolve it in the trial report. The trial measures
whether the kit *produced* the finding; whether it is correct is the owner's call.

**A trial that found nothing is a result**, and is recorded as one, including which parts of the
kit ran and produced no output.

---

## 7. After the trial

- [ ] Every kit defect filed as a task **before** any of them is fixed.
- [ ] Methodology failures added to §3 **with their detection**, not just their story.
- [ ] Results committed as `docs/TRIALS/<date>-<subject>.md` using the template below —
      `docs/TRIALS/TEMPLATE.md`. A shape each trialist invents is a shape nothing can compare.
- [ ] What the trial could not test, listed explicitly.
- [ ] The copy deleted, or kept and named as contaminated.

## Provenance of this document

Written 2026-08-12 before the first brownfield trial, from the greenfield run of 2026-08-01
(`docs/MEASUREMENTS.md`). §3 is that run's "Methodology warnings" promoted from narrative into
procedure, plus detections. The empty-review rule in §3 and the empty-denominator rule in §5
come from defects found in the kit's own review loop, not from a trial.

Revision 2 incorporates a T2 review that found 20 defects **before first use**, including the
two criticals named at the top. That review cost one agent run and would otherwise have been
paid for by a trial on a client codebase.

**This protocol is n=0.** It has never been executed. Its first execution is
`T-20260808-trial-the-kit-on-one-unfamiliar-brownfie`, which is also its first real test, and
the expected outcome is that this document changes again.
