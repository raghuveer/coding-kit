# verify-ladder

The ladder states **obligations**, not commands. An obligation is portable across
stacks; a command is not. This is the seam that lets a technology accelerator be added
later without editing this skill.

## Obligations

| Rung | Obligation | From (T) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The change compiles and satisfies static analysis | T0 |
| 2 | Stated acceptance criteria are proven by tests that fail without the change | T1 |
| 3 | The **wiring** fails as designed, not just the parsers — integration points, error paths, timeouts | T2 |
| 4 | An adversarial reader has looked for what the tests cannot express: fail-open guards, races behind a green suite, comments whose rationale is false | T2 |
| 5 | A second reader, given no sight of the first's findings, has done the same | T3 |

Rung 5 is a **completeness control, not a correctness control**, and the difference decides
whether it is worth its cost. Measured on one T3 design: two reviewers, the second blind at
a commit predating the first's findings, both returned REJECT and shared roughly 70% of
findings. Same verdict either way — so as insurance against a wrong call it bought nothing.

The 30% that differed is what it bought. Only the security reader found an unpinned hash
whose ambiguous pre-image lets a same-tenant attacker poison a victim's cached answer. Only
the design reader found that the proposed port set had no invalidation method at all.
Neither list contained the other's.

So do not run rung 5 expecting a second opinion on the verdict. Run it expecting a
different half of the problem, and treat convergence on the verdict as normal rather than
as evidence the rung is redundant.

## Satisfaction

Read `.claude/project-profile.md` for `commands.*` and `ladder.*` keys. Never invoke a
tool this skill names itself — it names none deliberately.

If a rung has **no satisfaction declared** for this stack, do not skip it silently.
Declare it unavailable, name the compensating control, and **raise the tier by one**.
Less mechanical verification means more adversarial reading, not a lower bar. A T3
change in a stack with no mutation tooling gets more human and reviewer attention, not
less.

## Recording findings

Every finding gets recorded, including from reviewers you disagree with. A reviewer returns
**one JSON object** — `verdict`, `narrative`, `findings` — and you pipe that whole reply in
**unchanged**. Do not read it and retype the fields: that is parsing, it is where every defect
in the old path came from, and on 2026-08-10 it dropped `pattern` from every row of a review.

**Prefer the loop.** Reviewers ignore the output rule — across four live runs it was ignored
three times — and repairing a reply by hand is the step that stops happening on the day it
matters. `kit-review-record.sh` runs the reviewer, hands the validator's own diagnostics back
if the reply is refused, retries a bounded number of times, and records a `finding-gap` if the
reviewer never complies:

```sh
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tooling/kit-review-record.sh \
  --task <task-id> --agent <agent> --max-attempts 3 \
  --prompt-file review-request.txt \
  --cmd '<command that reads a prompt on stdin and writes the reply to stdout>'
```

`--cmd` is the only place that knows how a reviewer is invoked here, so nothing about the
harness or the model leaks into the kit.

If you already have a reply in hand — **which is every review in plugin mode**, where a
reviewer is an Agent-tool subagent and there is no command that reads stdin and writes stdout —
record it through the same door the loop uses:

```sh
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tooling/kit-review-record.sh \
  --task <task-id> --agent <agent> --reply-file reviewer-reply.json
```

That validates the reply, records it, and **leaves a `finding-gap` if it is refused** — so a
review whose findings were rejected is still visible in the measurement. `kit-finding.sh --json`
still works and is what this calls, but it records nothing when it refuses, and a refused review
that leaves no row is the open circuit this whole path exists to close.

**What `--reply-file` cannot do is retry.** A correction restates the original request, and a
caller holding one finished reply has nothing to re-ask with. So in plugin mode the compliance
half is yours: read the diagnostics, ask the reviewer again, record its next reply. Across five
live rounds one model complied 3/3 and another 0/4, so expect to do this.

A reviewer that found nothing returns `{"findings": []}`, which records a `finding-gap` — an
empty review is a measurement, and it must not look like a review that never ran.

Rejection is **all-or-nothing**: one bad value and nothing is recorded, because a half-stored
review is a finding table that disagrees with the review it came from. The diagnostics name
every problem at once.

One finding at a time takes named flags: `--task --agent --class --severity --summary
[--lang] [--pattern] [--domain]`. `--summary` is required — without it the row is a bare
counter that cannot be told from any other. `kit-finding.sh --contract` prints the field list.
Both forms reject an unknown value rather than storing it, and a batch with any rejected row
exits non-zero — a partly recorded review is a measurement gap, and you are the only one
still holding the findings needed to fix it.

Do not memorise the vocabularies; print them:

```sh
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tooling/kit-finding.sh --vocab
```

`class` and `lang` are the entire mechanism by which technology and industry accelerators
are later improved from real work rather than invented. A finding recorded without them is
a finding that teaches nothing.

## Completion

Work is complete when every obligation at the declared tier is either satisfied or
explicitly declared unavailable with its tier raised. "I inspected it" satisfies no rung.
