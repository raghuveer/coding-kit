# Tasks are grouped by what they are ABOUT: a shared `epic:`, a shared source file, or a
# declared dependency. A file touched by more than hub_cap open tasks is treated as a hub
# (central config, main(), a barrel export) and does not link tasks — without that, one
# shared file fuses the whole backlog into a single cluster. Raise it if your clusters
# come out too fragmented; lower it if everything lands in cluster 1.

# (docs/DESIGN-NOTES.md): a minimum edge weight was tested and HURT, so there is no knob for
# one. max_degree is the self-check -- a graph whose average file co-changes with more than
# this is withheld rather than emitted, because answering "everything" is worse than unknown.

#   pattern     what is true of the DESIGN, whatever  (cache-port, idempotent-consumer)
#               the language and whatever the vertical
# The pattern axis exists because reviewers kept putting exactly this in `domain`. A cache
# port degrades the same way in TypeScript and in Go, and that is the reuse with the best
# amortisation: the design cost is paid once, not once per project.

Prose below the frontmatter is for humans and for the overlay agents. Record what is
true of **this codebase** and nothing that is true of the stack in general — stack facts
belong in an accelerator, where other projects can reuse them.
