#
# The fixture is deliberately awkward: a squash-shaped commit whose trailers git will not
# parse, module pairs that co-change, and a file in every commit that must be dropped as a
# hub. A fixture that only exercises the happy path proves the happy path.

# --- step selection --------------------------------------------------------
# `--only PATTERN` (repeatable, case-insensitive ERE, OR-ed) runs just the steps
# whose names match. It exists to make ONE mutation proof cheap: proving a single
# control can fail is the discipline this suite is for, and paying a whole run for
# it got that discipline batched into overnight runs instead of used.
#
# The full run is the only thing that proves conformance, and it is what CI runs.
# A filtered run is therefore built to be impossible to mistake for a whole one:
# the tally says PARTIAL and names how many steps did not run, the fingerprint is
# labelled as covering the chain rather than the suite, and a pattern matching no
# step exits 2 instead of reporting a clean zero-step pass. "Nothing ran" reading
# as green is the exact defect shape this repository keeps shipping -- see
# docs/LESSONS.md S1.
#
# Steps are not all independent. Most build and destroy their own fixture, but two
# groups share one, and those carry a chain name as `step`'s second argument.
# Selecting a chain member runs that chain from its start through the selected
# step, and says so. No step ever runs without the fixture it reads.
# Absolute, because a step below re-invokes this file to check the filter's own
# guarantees, and by then the fixture steps may have changed directory.

#
# `bash -n` DETECTS it and is already commands.lint. What it does not do is locate it: both
# times it reported the line where parsing finally broke, tens of lines below the cause,
# naming an unrelated token. So this step does not re-detect; it DIAGNOSES, by reporting the

# the commit moves `refs/heads/<branch>`. Measured on this repository before the fix:
# `.git/HEAD` was seventeen minutes older than the tip it pointed at, so `--if-stale` reported
# FRESH with history moved past the last build. Every git-derived input -- `touches`, and
# through it `tier_floor`, blast radius and co-change -- was invisible to the check, and
# `skills/task-context` step 1 is exactly this command.

# brownfield plus a stack delta. That claim is cheap to make and was, in the design, entirely
# untested: the branches existed and had never once executed.
#
# THIS STEP COVERS TWO OF THE THREE. Greenfield and an imported history are here. MODERNIZATION IS
# NOT: its source-to-target delta lives in the solution overlay, which is unbuilt, so there is

# than quietly counted as covered -- see T-20260815-ac6-modernization-delta-is-claimed-but-u. An

# the shape where a reader checks the box because the comment said so.

# Moves whenever templates/project-profile.md changes, because kit-init.sh copies it into
# the fixture's first commit. That is the cost of also using this as a drift detector:
# it forces a template edit to be noticed rather than silently changing what two
# platforms are comparing. Update it deliberately, never to make a red run go green.
# Moved TWICE on 2026-08-08, each time deliberately and each time with the cause
# established BEFORE re-pinning -- exactly one blob differing between the old and new seed
# trees, and that difference being exactly the intended edit. That is the work this check
# exists to force, and both times it forced it.
#   1. kit-init.sh writes `.project/index.db*` rather than `.project/index.db`, because the
#      indexer builds into `index.db.new` and marks a failed build with `index.db.failed`.
#   2. templates/project-profile.md now documents which tier.rule globs are refused, and
#      kit-init.sh copies that template into the fixture's first commit.
#   3. 2026-08-15: templates/project-profile.md gained `paths.adr` and `paths.design_input`
#      (ADR 0001). Same cause as 2 -- kit-init.sh copies the template into the seed commit.
#      The cause was established BEFORE re-pinning, as this comment requires, and the
#      evidence is: the previous commit still PASSED on the old pins, so the suite was not
#      broken; `git ls-tree -r` of the old and new seed trees differ in EXACTLY ONE blob,
#      `.claude/project-profile.md`; and `git cat-file -p` of the two blobs differs by
#      exactly the six added lines and nothing else. A full fresh-clone run was 64 passed,
#      1 failed, that one being this check -- so nothing else moved with it.
#   4. 2026-08-15: kit-init.sh now adds kit-entry.sh's four artefacts to the adoption
#      .gitignore, and .gitignore is in the seed commit. PREDICTED before the run rather than
#      diagnosed after it -- the mechanism is identical to 2 and 3, and a check whose next
#      failure you can name in advance is a check that is understood. Evidence, same discipline:
#      exactly one blob differs between the seed trees (`.gitignore`), its content differs by
#      exactly the four added lines, and the run was 67 passed with this as the only failure.
#   5. 2026-08-17: kit-init.sh now pins `.project/plans/*.tsv` to LF in the adoption
#      `.gitattributes`, and `.gitattributes` is in the seed commit (ADR 0004 — the plan is
#      committed text the indexer reads as data, so a CRLF checkout would carry a CR into the
#      goal id and the digest). PREDICTED before the run, like 4, and named in the commit that
#      caused it before CI was consulted. Evidence, same discipline, and one addition:
#      exactly one blob differs between the seed trees (`.gitattributes`), by exactly the two
#      added lines and nothing else; this was the ONLY failure across the 50 steps that ran.
#      The addition: the new seed was derived TWICE by independent routes — rebuilt by hand
#      from the fixture's own recipe, and printed by the suite — and the two agreed, which is
#      what distinguishes a re-pin from a guess.
#
#      **DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE WHILE A RUN OF IT IS IN FLIGHT.** These two constants were
#      re-pinned while the run that produced them was still executing, and bash reads a script
#      incrementally: the byte offsets shifted under the interpreter and it resumed mid-token,
#      emitting `line 3229: ow: command not found` and dying before the tally. Everything up to
#      the fixture step had already executed and is sound, but the last step's result and the
#      final `N passed, N failed` line were destroyed by the edit — a measurement invalidated by
#      the person reading it. Wait for the tally, then edit.
#      Specifically checked and PASSING: `delete and rebuild is lossless`, which a T3 security
#      review flagged as the likely second failure now that `plan_stale:` and `plan_refused`
#      rows are in the compared `.dump` and are written AFTER the atomic swap by a different
#      code path. It is not order-dependent. That was the reason for waiting for the whole run
#      before touching these two lines rather than re-pinning on the first red.
#      Re-pinned 2026-08-22, and the reason is nameable rather than "it moved": kit-init.sh
#      stopped writing `.project/entry-candidates.md` into .gitignore, because that file is a
#      model-authored proposal rather than derived output and is now tracked. The fixture commits
#      kit-init's output, so its content changed and its sha followed.
#      The diagnostic said which half moved before anything was touched -- "seed differs: a file
#      kit-init.sh commits is not byte-identical here" -- and ubuntu and macos computed the SAME
#      new pair, which is what makes this a re-pin rather than a reproducibility failure. Two
#      platforms agreeing on a new value is evidence; one platform moving would not be.
#      Re-pinned 2026-08-25, cause named in advance: the relicence added an SPDX header and a
#      commented `git.require_signoff` block to templates/project-profile.md, and kit-init.sh
#      copies that template into the fixture's seed commit. Same mechanism as 2, 3 and 5, and
#      PREDICTED before the run rather than diagnosed after it. Evidence, to the standard the
#      entries above set:
#        - a clean clone of `main` reproduced the OLD pins exactly on this machine (13 passed,
#          0 failed), so the fixture is reproducible here and the move has one cause;
#        - the two seed trees hold six files each and differ in EXACTLY ONE blob,
#          `.claude/project-profile.md`;
#        - that blob differs by exactly the 15 lines added to the template -- 7 of header at
#          the top, 8 of commented key after git.trivial_pattern -- and nothing else;
#        - `git ls-tree -r` on both seeds was compared directly, not inferred from the diff.
#      The two-platform half of note 5's standard is satisfied by CI rather than locally: this
#      is a re-pin only if ubuntu and macos both compute the same pair. If they disagree, this
#      is a reproducibility failure and the pins below are wrong.

# and emitted a 75-of-85-task cluster with full confidence — and the packs built from it were
# about to be the subject of an ROI experiment.
#
# The fixture reproduces the real mechanism rather than a synthetic blob: two epics, bridged by
# ONE low-degree shared file, which is exactly how this repository's seven epics fused. Measured
# there: README.md and SECURITY.md at degree 5 are kept as evidence while tests/conformance.sh at
# 13 is excluded as a hub, so the heuristic keeps the documentation and drops the code.
#
# BOTH directions are asserted. A check that only proves the refusal would pass against a
# mechanism that refused unconditionally, which would be a worse defect than the one being fixed.

# THE SMALL-BACKLOG FLOOR IS REGRESSION-TESTED ELSEWHERE, deliberately not duplicated here: the
# `--packs restores packs from a cloned plan` step above builds a TWO-task fixture, and two tasks
# in one cluster is 100% share. The first version of this check had no `cluster.min_tasks` floor
# and that step went red immediately — which is the only reason the defect was found before it
# shipped, since it would have withheld packs on every new or small backlog permanently. If this
# step is ever moved above that one, the floor loses its cover.
