#
# Accelerators are external, shared, versioned files. Two rules:
#
#   1. BOUND TO AGENTS, NOT SESSIONS. An accelerator is small at rest and large when
#      loaded. `resolve --agent X` returns only what X needs, so an industry
#      obligations list can be five thousand tokens and never reach the orchestrator.
#   2. CONTRIBUTION IS A PROPOSAL, NEVER A WRITE. `propose` emits candidate lines for
#      human review. An accelerator that auto-accumulates compounds one project's
#      mistake across every project that later loads it.
#
# Provenance is tracked per line: a seeded guess must never be mistaken for a finding
# that was earned. Unmarked seed content becomes permanent by default — that is the
# failure mode, not the seeding itself.
