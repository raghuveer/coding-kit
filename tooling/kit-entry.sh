# kit-entry.sh          turn an existing codebase into FACTS, anchored to files
#
# Writes three derived artefacts under `paths.state` and NOTHING else, ever:
#
#   entry-facts.tsv        one row per tracked file, uncapped
#   entry-comment-runs.tsv one row per run of consecutive comment lines, uncapped
#   entry-report.md        totals, degeneracy states, markers -- bounded, and every section
#                          states its ranking key
#
# It writes no task file, no SQL and no index row. That refusal is the only structural control
# in the entry design (ADR 0001) and it is exactly as strong as this script having no code that
# writes one -- the orchestrator that calls it holds Write and Bash, and kit-task.sh is not a
# gate. Stated, not pretended.
#
# WHY THERE IS NO AGGREGATION UNIT. A first design grouped by top-level directory ("areas") and
# inferred "this area has no rationale" from the doc-shaped files in it. Measured against three
# real repositories that was false in both directions: on THIS repository `tooling/` -- 1,554
# comment lines at 34.1% density, the densest rationale in the project -- reported zero, and on
# prometheus 13 of 23 areas reported zero including `config/` at 224 files. Directory
# attribution also destroys history: `(root)` absorbs 72% of prometheus's commits and 94% of
# actix-web's, because top-level files are touched constantly. So every fact here is anchored to
# a file, and the grouping is the model's job.
#
# WHY NOTHING IS CAPPED OR THRESHOLDED. The same measurement, on comment runs: a top-40 ranked
# section recovered 6 of 10 independently nominated rationale sites and did not move between a
# 4-line and a 12-line threshold, because the cap was doing the losing, not the threshold.
# Uncapped, all ten are reachable. Two of them sit in runs of 3 and 5 lines, so any minimum
# length applied HERE discards them permanently, while a reader can always filter a column.

# ---- --check: validate a proposal a model returned, before a human reads it -------------------
# Dispatched early, like kit-finding.sh's --vocab, because it neither reads the tree nor writes an
# artefact. It READS one file and returns a status.
#
# The format it enforces is docs/ENTRY-PROPOSAL.md. Two of the rules are load-bearing rather than
# cosmetic:
#
#   A question carries NO checkbox. A checkbox is a thing to tick and be done with; a question is
#   a thing to answer. This task exists because an undocumented design choice must be raised as a
#   QUESTION and never filed as work, and a tickbox beside one invites exactly the closing-without-
#   answering that the rule forbids.
#
#   A candidate title must be SAFE TO PASTE. ADR 0001 records the charset restriction as enforced
#   by nobody, on the grounds that "the tool never sees the titles" -- true of the design as
#   written, because the tool wrote facts and the model wrote the proposal. It is false here: the
#   orchestrator writes the file and this reads it back, so the shell metacharacters that would
#   execute at paste time can be refused rather than requested. Read the ADR knowing that.
#
# It does NOT enforce the hold. Nothing here stops anyone running kit-task.sh before a single
# question is answered, and a check that validated the shape and let the list be filed anyway
# would look like a gate while gating nothing.

  # WHITELIST THE WHOLE LINE. Do not extract the title and then inspect it: extraction has to
  # assume the quoting is well formed, and the one character that makes it malformed is the single
  # quote -- the very character most worth refusing. Two attempts got this wrong in opposite
  # directions and both were fail-open:
  #
  #   `[^\n]*` -- BSD read the class as "not backslash, not n", the substitution never matched,
  #               nothing was inspected, and EVERY title passed. Green on ubuntu, red on macos.
  #   `[^']*`  -- stops at the first quote, so `--title 'Doc's budget'` yields `Doc`, which is
  #               clean, and the quote arm became unreachable. Green on BOTH platforms while
  #               accepting the exact input it existed to refuse.
  #
  # So the shape is inverted: the line must MATCH a grammar of things known to be safe, and
  # anything else is refused unread. An unparseable line is refused rather than parsed, which is
  # the fail-closed direction. Adding a flag to kit-task.sh means adding it here, deliberately.
  # THE VOCABULARIES ARE BUILT FROM THEIR DEFINITION, NOT SPELLED OUT HERE. Listing the states
  # literally inside this pattern would put a copy of the vocabulary into the one file whose job
  # is refusing unsafe input, and it would go stale the day a state is added -- silently, because
  # an unlisted value is simply refused and a proposal that should pass would not. That is the
  # twenty-sixth copy docs/adr/0008 exists to prevent.
  #
  # The literal form is deliberately not quoted in this comment: written out, it matches the
  # conformance guard that hunts for it, and the step fails on this prose. That has now happened
  # three times in one change, which is the guard working rather than misfiring.
  #
  # ALTERNATION, NOT A BRACKET CLASS. `in-progress` and `on-hold` carry hyphens, which are range
  # operators inside `[...]` and literal inside `(a|b|c)`. Legacy spellings come from the same
  # definition with the canonical half stripped, so `--state done` stays valid input here exactly
  # as it is everywhere else.
  #
  # `--paths` allows `*` on purpose -- tier.rule matches globs -- and allows no quote, no `$`, no
  # backtick and no `;`, because the whole point of this gate is that the line is safe to PASTE.
  #
  # ORDER-INDEPENDENT: a REPEATED ALTERNATION of flags, not a fixed sequence of optional groups.
  # The sequence form silently made flag order mandatory -- `--state completed --via manual
  # --paths x` was refused while the same flags in another order passed -- and the message said
  # "not safe to paste", which is not what was wrong. With three optional flags that was survivable
  # and already true of `--epic` before `--lang`; with seven it is a trap, and CI found it by
  # refusing a line this suite itself had written in the obvious order.
  #
  # The repetition admits a duplicate flag (`--tier T1 --tier T2`). That is odd input, not unsafe
  # input, and kit-task.sh resolves it last-wins. This gate's question is whether the line is safe
  # to paste, not whether it is tidy -- widening it to police duplicates would be the extraction
  # this whole shape exists to avoid.
