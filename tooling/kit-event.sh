# THE GENERIC WRITER MAY NOT ADDRESS A KIND THE INDEXER ACTS ON.
#
# The boundary is not a list of bad words, it is a property: kit-index.sh either MUTATES a row
# for a kind, or merely records the event. The kinds it mutates for are the six below, and each
# has its own writer that validates -- findings and the three disposition marks through
# kit_findings.py, spend through kit-spend.sh, vindication through kit-vindicate.sh. This
# script validates nothing: it
# takes the kind as a free argument and splices its third argument in as raw JSON, so before this
# refusal it could mint any of them.
#
# `kit-event.sh T-x finding-fixed '{"finding":"<id>","fixed":1}'` set fixed_at on a real finding
# after a reindex, with kit_findings.py never invoked -- forging the one artefact
# .claude/CLAUDE.md reserves to the operator, on the grounds that clearing the gate that gates
# your own work is the certification the author cannot give. The same route minted findings whose
# class and severity were outside kit-finding.sh --vocab.
#
# kit-index.sh's dispatch is the AUTHORITY for this list, not this file. tests/conformance.sh
# derives the kinds from its `k=="..."` branches and fails if the two disagree, so teaching the
# indexer to act on a fifth kind without adding it here goes red rather than reopening the hole.
# `finding-superseded` added 2026-08-20, BY THIS CHECK GOING RED rather than by anyone
# remembering. The verb landed with its own guard -- kit-resolve.sh refuses it unless the subject
# file carries a matching `Superseded-by:` line -- and that guard is worth nothing if the generic
# writer can mint the event directly. It clears the criticals gate exactly as `finding-fixed`
# does, so it belongs here for exactly the same reason.
