# THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT SERIALISE. Every event line is built by kit_findings.py with json.dumps.
# It used to be built here with printf, and both T3 reviewers found the same critical: only
# `summary` was normalised, so `lang`, `pattern`, `domain` and `file` reached an append-only
# COMMITTED log raw. One quote corrupts the line permanently, and because the awk reader takes
# the first match, a crafted `lang` could inject a key the indexer would then prefer over the
# real one. Keep serialisation in one place with one writer.
#
# `--batch` was DELETED with that printf. It carried no `summary`, so it could only produce the
# bare-counter rows the contract exists to abolish, and its pipe-delimited format is one no
# reviewer emits any more. Deleting a component beats hardening it -- docs/LESSONS.md S5.
#
# --vocab exists because these lists were restated in the schema comment, in two skills and
# in the agent output contracts, and all four had drifted -- the agents emitted severities
# this script rejected outright, so most findings never recorded. Print the vocabulary
# rather than remembering it.
