# kit-guard.sh — PreToolUse net: the kit never writes outside the project root.
# A net, not a security boundary: the real boundary is that scripts use paths
# relative to the root. Parse failure allows the write and warns, because a
# guard that blocks every edit on a malformed payload is a guard people remove.
#
# Three path forms are in play on Windows -- git reports C:/repo, bash reports /c/repo,
# and the tool payload carries C:\repo. Comparing them raw made this check decorative:
# a C:\... path failed the leading-slash test, was taken for a relative path, and was
# waved through unexamined. Everything below is normalised into one form before compare.

# EVERY KEY THE MATCHED TOOLS CAN CARRY, not just one. The hook matcher is
# Write|Edit|NotebookEdit, but this read only "file_path" -- and NotebookEdit names its target
# "notebook_path". So P came back empty for it, the no-target branch below took the fail-open
# path, and a NotebookEdit anywhere on disk was waved through unexamined while SECURITY.md
# claimed the tool was refused. Write outside the root exited 2; NotebookEdit outside exited 0.
#
# This list is the ONE place the mapping lives, and tests/conformance.sh asserts that the hook
# matcher names no tool absent from it -- so adding a fourth tool to hooks.json without teaching
# this line goes red instead of quietly failing open. Two lists in two files agreeing by luck is
# what produced the defect.
#
# First match, not last. A greedy .* walks to the FINAL key in the payload, so writing a file
# whose own content mentions file_path checked that inner value instead of the real target.
# grep -o emits matches in order; head -1 takes the tool's own argument. The alternation keeps
# that property: the first occurrence of EITHER key is still the tool's own.
# The trailing sed undoes JSON's doubled backslashes.
