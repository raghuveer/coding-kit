# ---- tier floors -------------------------------------------------------------
# tier.rule is `<path-glob> <tier>`, repeatable. A floor RAISES a tier and never lowers it,
# so a task recorded above its floor is correct and is not flagged.
#
# Matched from two sources, and both are needed. Files a task has already touched come from
# the edge table -- but 7 of 8 open tasks in a real backlog had no touches edges, because
# nothing is committed against a task until work begins. A floor that only sees touched files
# therefore passes silently on every task that has not started, which is exactly when the tier
# still matters: it gates the review that happens DURING the work.
#
# So a task may also declare `paths:` in its frontmatter -- the globs it expects to change.
# Optional, additive, ignored by older kits.
# Rejected here, at the single point both floor paths read from, rather than in either of
# them. A glob containing `[` or `]` cannot mean the same thing on both sides: SQLite GLOB
# honours `[ab]` as a character class (measured), while the awk path would have to translate
# it into an exactly equivalent regex class -- and until it does, one of the two floors would
# quietly differ from the other. An unbalanced `[` is worse than that: SQLite GLOB silently
# never matches, and the regex is uncompilable, which took the whole task pass down.
#
# So the rule is refused and SAID, rather than half-applied. A floor that means two things is
# worse than a floor that is missing and announced -- this is the control that decides how
# many reviewers a change gets.
#
# The refusal is RECORDED, not just printed. kit-status.sh runs the indexer with stderr
# discarded and its output is a file read later, so a warning that exists only on a terminal
# nobody was watching is not a refusal anyone hears -- and the artifact then says "no declared
# paths:" about a task that declares them, which is a false cause dressed as a benign one.
#
# ONE parse, here, emitting the already-split form. There used to be two: this validator read
# the LAST whitespace field as the tier, and a `sed` downstream cut at the FIRST whitespace
# run. They agree on a two-token rule and disagree on everything else -- so `src/** ',x T3`
# passed validation on its trailing `T3` while the consumers took the tier to be `',x T3`.
# That floor sorts below every real tier, so `tier < tier_floor` never fired and an
# under-tiered task simply stopped being reported. Measured: the below-floor section vanished
# from STATUS.generated.md entirely, exit 0, nothing refused.
#
# A validator that checks a different token than the consumers use is not a validator. Two
# fields, both checked, emitted tab-separated so there is nothing left to re-split.

# %ad in an explicit UTC format, not %aI. Two reasons, both found by running one fixture on
# Windows and Debian and diffing the resulting index:
#
#   1. %aI renders the same instant differently across git versions -- 2.47 emits
#      ...T00:00:00Z where 2.41 emits ...T00:00:00+00:00 -- so a mixed-platform team
#      derives different index content from identical history.
#   2. %aI carries the author LOCAL offset, and `at` is TEXT that ORDER BY compares as a
#      string. A commit at 05:30+05:30 then sorts after one at 02:00Z despite being
#      earlier, so state, owner and tier could be derived from the wrong commit.
#
# TZ=UTC0 with format-local renders every commit in one canonical zone, matching the
# `date -u` format kit-finding.sh already writes into events.ndjson. Both sources now
# produce strings whose lexical order is their chronological order.
# -c core.quotepath=false: by default git renders a path containing any byte above 0x7F as
# `"src/\303\251.go"` -- quoted, and octal-escaped. That name is what lands in the `touches`
# edge, so a non-ASCII path is recorded under a name matching no glob, no tier.rule and no
# other reader of the index. Measured, not assumed.
#
# The flag suppresses that escaping for bytes above 0x7F AND NOTHING ELSE. git quotes
# independently for a double quote, a backslash or any control byte, all of which are legal
# filenames on a POSIX checkout, and no flag turns that off. Measured: a path containing a
# backslash still arrives quoted with the flag on. Those are dropped and counted where the
# paths are read, because a floor that cannot be applied has to be announced.

cat <<'DERIVE'
-- A `Task-Id` in a trailer is a REFERENCE, not a task, and the difference is a file. Inventing
-- a task row for one was how a single-character typo in a pushed commit became a permanent open
-- task with no title and no epic -- in the Open list, in the backlog count, and in the
-- escape-rate denominator of a tier nobody ever assigned it. The controls that exist all act
-- earlier (kit-trailers.sh warns at commit time, pre-push blocks before sharing) and none of
-- them help for history already pushed, which is the only case that matters here.
--
-- So the node is created and the task row is not. The node keeps the graph whole for the edges
-- that point at the id -- `depends_on` from a blocked_by, `regressed` from a Fixes-Escape-Of --
-- and it is what kit-status.sh reads to name these ids at all. What used to be an
-- invented task is now named by kit-status.sh with the commit that introduced it, on the rule
-- this kit already applies to unattributed spend, refused tier.rules and unusable paths: what
-- could not be resolved is reported rather than silently discarded. Silently INVENTED is worse
-- than either, because it reads as work.
--
-- WHERE THE RULE ACTUALLY LIVES, since this is the third thing a reader looks at and the first
-- two were misleading: `task` rows come from section 2 and from nowhere else -- one INSERT per
-- parsed FILE. There is no statement here that admits a task, so a file is the only way in. An
-- earlier version of this change added a guarded INSERT here, `path IS NOT NULL`, which read
-- like the gate implementing all of it and was dead code: section 2 has already inserted a row
-- for every file, so it could never find one to add. Measured, then deleted -- indexing with and
-- without it produced identical task rows. What stops a phantom is the ABSENCE below, not a
-- guard, and an absence needs saying out loud or the next reader restores the invention.
--
-- An id that later gains a file therefore needs no reconciliation step: the file starts
-- producing the row, and nothing here has to notice. A task filed after the commit that
-- referenced it is a normal sequence, not an error.
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO node
  SELECT DISTINCT task_id,'task',NULL,task_id FROM event WHERE task_id IS NOT NULL AND task_id<>'';

-- git records what tier was actually used; frontmatter only declares an intent.
-- LAST WINS, ordered by `seq` and not by `at`, at every one of these derivations.
--
-- `at` is `%ad`, the AUTHOR date, which is whatever `GIT_AUTHOR_DATE` said -- so ordering by it
-- let a future-dated commit pin a value permanently: no later commit could ever be "after" it,
-- and a `Via: kit` so dated could never be retracted. Found against the via derivation in the
-- review of 2026-08-12 and swept to all four, because it is one shape in four places and
-- fixing only the instance that was reported is the mistake this repository keeps making
-- (docs/LESSONS.md S4).
--
-- `seq` is AUTOINCREMENT and the log is walked with `--reverse`, oldest commit first, so it is
-- the order the history actually happened in and nothing in a commit message can reorder it.

-- NORMALISE THE AUTHORED VALUE FIRST. A task file may carry a legacy spelling forever -- 115 of
-- 130 say `open` today -- so the written value is resolved through state_alias before anything
-- reads it. A value in NO alias row is left exactly as written rather than guessed at: an
-- unrecognised state is a typo to report, and quietly rewriting it to something plausible is how
-- a typo becomes permanent.
UPDATE task SET state = (SELECT a.canonical FROM state_alias a WHERE a.written = task.state)
  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM state_alias a WHERE a.written = task.state);

-- Then the last transition wins, resolved through the same table. The join to state_alias is
-- what restricts this to state events -- `finding`, `spend` and the rest are not alias rows --
-- and it is also what keeps the 127 commits already carrying `started`/`progress`/`done`
-- readable, which is why they never had to be rewritten.

-- A finding harvested from a reviewer carries no task: the hook that harvests it fires when
-- the reviewer stops, and nothing in this kit tracks a current task. Bound the same way spend
-- is -- to the next task-status transition at or after it -- because it is the same question
-- with the same available evidence, and one attribution rule is one rule to get right.
--
-- The CASE sits INSIDE the selected row for the reason spend's does: as a WHERE clause it does
-- not stop the search, it skips to the next REAL transition however unrelated, and files the
-- finding against a task that had nothing to do with it. Measured on spend, fixed there, and
-- the identical shape would be identically wrong here.
-- state_alias, NOT state_class, and the difference is a regression this already caused.
-- state_class holds the CANONICAL seven; state_alias holds every spelling that has ever been
-- written, legacy included. Attribution binds a finding to the next task-status transition, and
-- those transitions are real events carrying whatever word was current when they were recorded --
-- 87 of them say `progress`. Matching against state_class silently attributed nothing, and two
-- conformance steps went red. Anything that reads an EVENT KIND must join state_alias.

-- Attribute spend to a task. The hook that fires when an agent finishes does not know which
-- task it was serving, so the link is inferred: the next task-status transition at or after
-- the spend. Work is committed with a trailer when it completes, so the transition that
-- follows a burn of tokens is normally the task those tokens were spent on.
--
-- It is a heuristic and it fails in the obvious ways -- two tasks in flight at once, a
-- session that ends without a commit. That is why unattributed spend is REPORTED rather than
-- dropped: a cost table missing its expensive rows reads as cheap work, not as measurement
-- that did not happen.
-- The existence test is INSIDE the selected row, not in the WHERE clause, and the difference
-- is the whole finding. Written as `AND EXISTS (...)` it does not stop the search -- it makes
-- LIMIT 1 skip the phantom's transition and bind to the next REAL one instead, however far in
-- the future and however unrelated. Measured: spend, then a T-ghost transition, then a later
-- unrelated T-real transition, and the cost landed on T-real, at T-real's tier, with zero
-- unattributed and no warning anywhere. That is not the third category this guard was added to
-- prevent; it is a fourth and worse one -- attributed to the WRONG thing and reading as right,
-- where the previous behaviour at least kept it on the id the trailer actually named.
--
-- So the nearest transition is chosen FIRST, on time alone, exactly as the heuristic describes;
-- only then is it required to be a real task. A CASE with no ELSE yields NULL, so a phantom
-- nearest neighbour leaves the row unattributed and the warning below says so. The heuristic
-- may still be wrong about WHICH task -- it is a heuristic -- but it can no longer be wrong
-- about which task it CHOSE.

# A fix mark names a commit. Nothing checked that the commit is still in this history, so a
# branch that was rebased away, or a SHA that never existed, left the finding marked fixed
# forever with its evidence pointing at nothing. Checked here rather than in SQL because only
# git can answer it, and only for rows that carry a SHA -- a handful, not a walk of the log.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DETECT, said plainly: a REVERT. A reverted fix leaves its commit in
# history and adds another undoing it, so the mark still resolves and still reads as addressed.
# Deciding whether a later commit undoes an earlier one is not a lookup, and pretending this
# covers it would be the false-rationale this kit exists to refuse.
# Counts MARKS, not distinct commits, because that is what the report says it counts -- three
# marks citing one vanished SHA under-reported as one. And read with `while read`, not
# `for _c in $(...)`: an unquoted command substitution word-splits and globs, and a value stored
# before `--commit` was validated is arbitrary text. That is the interpolation shape LESSONS §4
# says to sweep for rather than fix one instance of, and it was introduced here while fixing
# something else.
# A plan survives a rebuild now (ADR 0004), so for the first time it can outlive the backlog
# it was computed from: tasks close, split, or change tier underneath it. That possibility is
# the COST of persisting it, and a carried-forward plan that could not say it was stale would
# be a worse defect than the one this fixed -- a plan that visibly vanished, replaced by one
# that is confidently wrong.
#
# Compared here rather than in the SQL stream because the digest is computed from the finished
# index, and by the one function kit-plan.sh also calls. Two copies of that query would report
# every plan permanently stale or permanently fresh, and both fail silently.
