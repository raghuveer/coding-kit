# kit_plan_digest <index.db> -> an opaque string for "the backlog this plan was computed from".
#
# ADR 0004 makes the plan survive a rebuild, which means it can now outlive its inputs — a
# possibility the old behaviour did not have, because the plan never outlived anything.
# `kit-plan.sh` stamps this into the plan file and `kit-index.sh` recomputes it on every
# rebuild, so THE TWO MUST AGREE ON WHAT IT COVERS. One home, called from both: two copies
# would report a plan permanently stale or permanently fresh, and both failures are silent.
#
# Deliberately NOT over `touches` edges, though clustering uses them. Those move on every
# commit, so including them would mark the plan stale the moment anyone commits anything —
# a warning that is always on is one people learn to skip, and this repository has already
# paid for that once (`git.trivial_pattern`, docs/MEASUREMENTS.md §B.6).
#
# `cksum` rather than a hash: POSIX, present on all three platforms the kit runs on, and this
# detects change rather than resisting forgery — the digest is recomputed from the index and
# only COPIED into the plan file, so no hash would resist an editor who writes the current
# value. `state` is a filter and not a field: a task moving open -> progress does not reorder
# the plan, and stamping it would say otherwise.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, said here rather than discovered later. This answers "is this the
# same BACKLOG the plan was computed from", NOT "is this still the ordering that backlog
# produces". The score is `w_unblocks*unblocks + w_escapes*escapes + w_tier*tier` and clustering
# unions on shared non-hub files, so a new `escaped` event, a new `touches` edge, or an edit to
# `priority.w_*` / `cluster.hub_cap` in the profile all reorder the plan while this value is
# unchanged. Two T3 reviewers raised the gap independently. `touches` is excluded deliberately —
# it moves on every commit, and a warning that is always on is one people learn to skip — but
# that argument does not extend to the profile weights, and callers must not read "fresh" as
# "the ordering is still current".
#
# Returns EMPTY when the query fails, and callers treat empty as stale. It used to swallow the
# failure and pipe an empty stream into `cksum`, which yields the same value an empty backlog
# does — so two uncomputable digests compared equal and cleared the staleness warning.

# kit_via_vocab -> how a unit of work was executed. THE definition; every consumer reads it

# vocabulary was restated in four places once and the agents emitted values the recorder threw
# away; this one starts with a single home.
#
#   kit      this project's own pipeline ran on it -- tiered, spawned, reviewed
#   agent    a coding agent did it, without the kit
#   manual   a human did it
#   unknown  nobody can say, which on a brownfield back-fill is most of the backlog
#
# `unknown` is a real value that reports as unknown. It is not a synonym for `manual`, and it
# is the default precisely so that an unrecorded task is visibly absent from a comparison
# rather than quietly counted into one.
#
# THE HUMAN GATE IS THE POINT. A model may propose the value; a person confirms it. A
# self-reported `kit` from the agent that did the work is the one value nobody should take on
# trust, which is why nothing in the kit ever writes this for you.

# ---- TASK STATE: one home for the vocabulary and for every partition of it ----------------
#
# Same rule as kit_via_vocab above and for the same reason, measured rather than argued. On
# 2026-08-22 the question "is this task closed?" was answered by the literal `'done','abandoned'`
# in NINETEEN places across four files, while "is this a legal state?" was answered once. A rule
# with nineteen copies is a rule that will disagree with itself; the finding vocabulary already
# did exactly that across four locations here. See docs/adr/0008.

# SQL CONSUMERS DO NOT READ THESE FUNCTIONS DIRECTLY. kit-index.sh derives a `state_class` table
# from them and the queries join against it, because the derivation SQL lives in a QUOTED heredoc
# (`cat <<'DERIVE'`) where no shell expansion happens. Text is truth, the table is derived and
# disposable -- the same split this repository applies to task files and index.db.
# A LIFECYCLE, not a bag of values. The previous six were `started progress blocked unblocked
# done abandoned`, of which THREE had never been used across 130 tasks -- `blocked`, `unblocked`
# and `abandoned` all measured zero -- while `open`, the most-used value in the repository at 115
# tasks, was not in the list at all. See docs/adr/0008.

#   completed    implementation finished
#   cancelled    NO LONGER RELEVANT -- a judgement about the WORK
#   abandoned    WE STOPPED -- a judgement about the ATTEMPT
#
# `cancelled` and `abandoned` are both kept and that is the point of the change. Collapsing them
# either way loses the distinction: filing dropped attempts as `cancelled` asserts they were never
# worth doing, which is the original complaint mirrored.
#

# reads for layering, and the measured fate of a state that duplicates it is `blocked` -- zero uses.

# that files 200 inventory items of which 120 are cancelled turns 5 escapes over 80 real tasks --
# 6.25% -- into 5 over 200 -- 2.5%, and the pipeline looks better for having filed nothing.
#
# `abandoned` IS measured: it was real work this pipeline touched, and hiding it would flatter the
# record in the other direction. Open states are measured too -- work in flight is still work, and
# this is deliberately NOT `kit_state_closed` inverted.
#
