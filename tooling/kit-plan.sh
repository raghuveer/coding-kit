# Groups tasks by dependency, orders them by completion priority, and persists the
# result. Two rules make this correct rather than merely plausible:
#
#   1. TOPOLOGY BEATS PRIORITY. A high-scoring task blocked by a low-scoring one
#      cannot go first. Priority orders *within* a layer, never across layers.
#   2. THE PLAN IS STATE, NOT CONTEXT. The ordering is computed once and written to
#      the index. A task session reads one row — not the plan, not the graph. This
#      is what stops a multi-task goal from growing an orchestrator window.
#
# Cycles are a data error, not something to order around: they are reported and the
# affected tasks are withheld from the plan rather than silently mis-sequenced.

# ---- where the plan lives (ADR 0004) -------------------------------------------------
# `goal` and `plan_item` are the only tables written by a tool other than kit-index.sh, and
# nothing could rebuild them from text -- so every kit-index.sh run dropped them, and
# skills/task-context step 1 IS a kit-index.sh run while its step 4 reads plan_item. The plan
# is now written as a text file and the index is derived from it, like every other input.
#
# Defined here, above the awk, because the creation timestamp has to be read out of any
# existing plan file BEFORE the SQL that inserts the goal row is generated. It used to be
# `strftime('now')` inside that SQL, which re-stamped the goal on every rebuild and would have
# made "delete the index, rebuild, compare" false for a reason having nothing to do with the
# plan.
# A GOAL ID IS A PATH SEGMENT AND AN AGENT LOADS WHAT IT POINTS AT, so it is constrained here
# rather than sanitised later. `skills/task-context` step 4 builds
# `.project/packs/<goal_id>/c<cluster>.md` from the value stored in `plan_item` and places the
# result "early and verbatim" in the model's context. A T3 security review demonstrated the
# consequence with a committed plan file carrying `goal_id = ../../docs`: the path resolved to
# `<root>/docs/c1.md` and an agent would have inlined whatever that file said, wearing the
# authority of frozen kit-generated context.
#
# The previous shape SLUGGED the value for the filename and stored it RAW in the table, which
# made those two things different keys for one goal. That alone produced three defects, all
# found independently: the orphaned-pack check compared a slug against a raw id and could never
# match; `"Q3 launch"` and `"Q3-launch"` shared one plan file and silently overwrote each other;
# and the skill's own path was built from the raw id and pointed at a directory that does not
# exist. Refusing the input makes slug and id THE SAME VALUE, so none of those states is
# reachable rather than each being patched.
#
# Refused, not rewritten. A silently rewritten goal id is a second name for the operator's goal,
# and this file already carries what that costs.

#
# It is a snapshot on purpose. Regenerating per session would break byte-identity and put
# the 1.25x write premium back; findings that land mid-cluster are picked up at the next
# `kit-plan.sh` run. Derived, disposable, gitignored -- deleting the packs loses nothing.
# sqlite3 on Windows writes CRLF. Command substitution strips the trailing newline but not
# the CR, so `for C in $(sqlite3 ...)` yields "1<CR>" and the pack is written as
# "c1<CR>.md" -- a filename that lists correctly and cannot be opened by the name you type.
# gawk strips CR in text mode, which is why the clustering above is unaffected and only the

# ---- the clustering self-check (cluster.max_share) ------------------------------------
# A cluster holding most of the backlog is not a grouping, and a pack built from one is the
# "answers everything" artefact this kit refuses elsewhere: kit-index.sh WITHHOLDS a co-change
# graph whose average degree exceeds cochange.max_degree, on the stated grounds that answering
# everything is worse than an honest unknown. Clustering had no equivalent and emitted a
# 70-of-85-task cluster with full confidence.
#
# THE ORDERING IS NOT WITHHELD, only the packs. Layers come from topology and ranks from score;
# both are still correct when clustering degenerates. It is the PACK that becomes a 2.4k-token
# list of most of the repository, and it is the only thing here that gets worse rather than
# merely less useful.
#
# Measured on this repository 2026-08-18, and the reason this check is not simply "tune
# cluster.hub_cap": the knob is inert across its useful range. hub_cap 5 -> largest 75 of 85;
# hub_cap 3 -> 74 of 85; hub_cap 1 -> 16 of 85. Only switching the file signal OFF entirely
# changes the answer, because the files doing the fusing have LOW degree -- README.md and
# SECURITY.md at 5, INSTALL.md at 3 -- while tests/conformance.sh at 13 and tooling/kit-index.sh
# at 6 are excluded as hubs. The heuristic assumes cross-cutting files are high-degree; here the
# cross-cutting surface is documentation and it is low-degree, so degree is an inverted proxy.
# A refusal is honest while that is unresolved; a tuned knob would only look resolved.
# A SHARE NEEDS A DENOMINATOR BIG ENOUGH TO MEAN SOMETHING. Two tasks in one cluster is 100%
# and is not degeneracy — it is a small project. The first version of this check had no floor,
# and the conformance suite caught it immediately: the clone-recovery fixture has two tasks, so
# its packs were withheld and `--packs` had nothing to restore. Shipped, that would have withheld
# packs on every new or small backlog permanently, which is the opposite of the intent.
