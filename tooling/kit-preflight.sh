    # A refuted critical is excluded ONLY IF the refutation is unambiguous. `kit-vindicate.sh`
    # keys on (task, class) and marks every finding matching both, so on a task with two
    # `fail-open` findings a single `--false` about the harmless one also refutes the critical
    # -- and the critical would leave the gate having never been judged. Fail closed: a
    # class-scoped refutation retires a finding only when it is the sole finding of that class
    # on that task.
    # A finding the operator has explicitly marked unassessable leaves the gate, and ONLY one
    # marked individually does. The exclusion is deliberately not `summary IS NULL` -- that
    # would exempt every FUTURE critical whose summary is missing, turning a bounded historical
    # problem into an unbounded hole. Nine rows predate the summary column and cannot be judged

    # it into zero. Excluded from the gate, never from the record.

    # the mark names what withdrew the subject, and kit-resolve.sh refuses it unless the subject
    # file itself carries a matching `Superseded-by:` line -- so this exclusion is reachable only
