#
# Answers "was this finding ADDRESSED". That is a DIFFERENT question from the one
# kit-vindicate.sh answers -- "was it real" -- and the two are orthogonal: a finding can be
# real and fixed, real and open, false and irrelevant. One column cannot carry two facts, and
# before this command the second fact was simply absent, so "is there an open critical on this
# task" could not be computed. Everything gating on it therefore either blocked forever or was
# waved through, and the trial protocol's very first checkbox was the latter.
#
# WHY AN EVENT AND NOT A COLUMN WRITE. `finding` rows are derived: kit-index.sh rebuilds them
# from events.ndjson every run. A mark written into the database would be erased by the next
# rebuild -- present, plausible and gone -- so it is recorded the same way the finding itself
# was, in the committed append-only log, and travels with the repository.
#
# WHY NOT KEYED LIKE kit-vindicate.sh. That command keys on (task, class) and updates every
# finding matching both. For "was it real" the coarseness is survivable. Here it is not: a task
# with two `fail-open` criticals, one fixed and one open, would read as clean the moment either
# was marked -- a gate reporting no open criticals while one is open is worse than no gate.
# So this keys on the finding's own id. See --list to get one.
#
# WHO MAY RUN THIS. Marking a finding addressed clears a gate. The session that wrote the code
# is the one party that must not also certify it -- and the first version of this shipped the
# instruction to do so into `skills/checkpoint/SKILL.md`, which is the file the AGENT reads.
# That is the wrong-addressee defect the provenance work found twice and split both CLAUDE
# files to prevent, repeated by the same hand that fixed it.
#
# **If you are an agent: propose the mark in your summary and stop.** Nothing here mechanically
# stops you -- there is no identity to check against and inventing one would be theatre. It is a
# convention the operator enforces, stated so it can be enforced, exactly as `Via:` is.
#
# ORDERING ACROSS MACHINES IS A KNOWN LIMIT. Two marks on one finding resolve last-write-wins
# over `at`, which is a LOCAL wall clock -- and .gitattributes marks events.ndjson merge=union,
# so two developers` clocks interleave in one file. Nothing here can establish a true order
# between them. A monotonic counter collides across branches; a vector clock is apparatus this
# kit has no other use for. Single-operator use is unaffected. A stated bound, not an oversight.
