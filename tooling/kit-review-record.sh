#
# Run a reviewer, validate what it returns, hand back the validator's own diagnostics if it was
# refused, and record the result. The loop that closes the findings circuit.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The contract asks a reviewer to return one JSON object. Across four live
# runs it was ignored three times -- a reporting tool was called instead, an object arrived
# wrapped in a fence, a summary ran to 208 characters. Each time a human read the diagnostics
# and fixed the reply by hand, which is exactly the intervention this task's first acceptance
# criterion forbids. A system prompt is a request. This is the mechanism.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: spawn the reviewer itself. `--cmd` is supplied by the caller and is the
# only thing that knows how a reviewer is invoked here, so no harness name, CLI or model
# appears in this file. The contract with that command is one line:
#
#     it reads a prompt on stdin and writes the reviewer's whole reply to stdout.
#
# WHAT `--cmd` DOES NOT PREVENT -- read this before trusting a review's independence.
# Whatever tool restriction you put in that command is a REQUEST to the harness, not a
# boundary this script imposes. Demonstrated 2026-08-16: a reviewer launched with exactly
# `--allowedTools "Read,Grep,Glob" --disallowedTools "ReportFindings"` ran `Bash` anyway --
# the session transcript shows the `tool_use` with `is_error: false`. So:
#
#   - A reviewer CAN read anything the operator can read, run shell commands, and in
#     principle edit the code it is reviewing. `agents/*-reviewer.md` saying "read-only by
#     design" is behavioural shaping and nothing more.
#   - Nothing here compares the tools an agent declared against the tools it used. The one
#     violation seen was noticed only because the reviewer disclosed it unprompted.
#   - What IS enforced: the reply is written to a file and validated, never executed, and
#     `kit-guard.sh` refuses Write/Edit/NotebookEdit outside the project root -- though that
#     hook does not match `Bash`, so a shell command is not covered.
#
# If a review's independence has to survive an uncooperative reviewer, isolate the process
# (a container, a copy with no remote per `kit-preflight.sh --isolated`) and diff the tree
# afterwards. Do not rely on the flag. `SECURITY.md` §3 carries the full account.
#
# ATTEMPTS ARE BOUNDED and the bound is not a formality: a reviewer that cannot satisfy the
# contract in N tries will not satisfy it in twenty, and an unbounded loop against a paid
# endpoint is a bill, not a retry. When the attempts run out the failure is RECORDED as a
# finding-gap, because a review whose findings were refused is a hole in the measurement and
# the one thing it must not be is silent.
