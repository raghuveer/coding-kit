# kit-spend.sh — record what a unit of work actually cost.
#
# Invoked from the SubagentStop and Stop hooks with the hook JSON on stdin. Nobody types it,
# which is the whole point: a spend record that needs remembering is missing exactly on the
# busy tasks that matter, and a partial cost table reads as CHEAP work rather than UNMEASURED
# work -- the same failure escape rate had while the findings loop was open circuit.
#
# WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM. No hook payload carries token usage, so transcripts are the
# only source. There are two kinds and they do not overlap:
#
#   <project>/<session-id>.jsonl                        the MAIN LOOP's turns
#   <project>/<session-id>/subagents/**/agent-<id>.jsonl  one file per subagent
#
# The session transcript contains NO subagent records at all -- measured, 0 of 347 records
# sidechain on a 105-subagent run. The first version of this script read only that file and
# labelled the result with whichever agent had just stopped, so every "per-agent" row held
# main-loop cost. Populated, plausible and wrong, which is worse than empty. Hence the rule
# below: a row is labelled with an agent only when it was read from that agent's own file.
#
# WHAT IS AND IS NOT COST. Four surfaces report subagent tokens and they disagree by 5-215x,
# because they measure three different things (T-20260808 spike):
#
#   sum of raw usage fields   17,148,335   prices a cache read like fresh input
#   harness subagent_tokens    2,463,029   final CONTEXT SIZE summed -- blind to work done
#   summed output_tokens         169,383   work, but only the generated part
#   billing-weighted             6,378,878 what was actually billed
#
# So this records the four raw counters PER TURN-SUM plus the final context size, and leaves
# the weighting to kit-status.sh, where the multipliers live in one place. Storing a
# pre-weighted total would freeze today's price list into a committed log.
#
# ONE ROW PER TRANSCRIPT, keyed on the agent id (opaque already) or on a hash of the session
# transcript path (which names the project directory, and this log is committed). Totals are
# cumulative for the transcript, so the row is REPLACED, never summed -- and an unchanged
# total is not appended at all, which is what stops Stop and SubagentStop writing nine
# events for four agent runs.
#
#   kit-spend.sh                      # hook JSON on stdin
#   kit-spend.sh --transcript F [--agent NAME] [--agent-id ID] [--session ID]
