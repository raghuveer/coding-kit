# Creates one task file. Tasks are FILES; the index is derived from them. Nothing is
# ever written to the database directly — kit-index.sh would overwrite it on the next
# rebuild, and a second source of truth is the failure this whole design avoids.
#
# Intended use: a researcher proposes a breakdown, a human confirms and edits, then
# this writes the confirmed tasks. The confirmation is the gate — a model writing
# straight to disk means the model is setting your backlog.
