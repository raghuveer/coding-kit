# The hook and the CI gate both call this; neither reimplements it. 0.2.1 fixed a bug that
# existed for exactly that reason -- the hook grepped the whole message while the indexer
# read git's trailer block, so commits passed the gate and then vanished from derived
# status. Two validators of the same thing drift apart silently. One cannot.
#
# Exit 0 when clean, or when enforcement is `warn`. Exit 1 when enforcement is `enforce`
# and something failed. --enforce overrides the profile, which is what CI wants: a gate
# that only warns is not a gate.
