"""Read, validate and WRITE reviewer findings. The JSON boundary, in one place.

Reviewers used to return a prose block that something -- a hook scraping a transcript, or a
person reading the markdown and retyping it -- had to parse back into fields. Every defect in
that path came from the parsing. The fix is not a better parser. The reviewer returns data.

Python rather than shell because `python3` is already a hard dependency (validate.py runs in
CI), so the constraint that once justified hand-rolling JSON with awk and sed was never real
-- docs/LESSONS.md S7.

THIS MODULE ALSO WRITES, and that is a correction. The first version validated here and let
`kit-finding.sh` build the event line with printf, on the principle that one module decides and
another records. Both T3 reviewers found the same critical: that printf interpolated `lang`,
`pattern`, `domain` and `file` unescaped into an append-only COMMITTED log, and because the awk
reader takes the first match, a crafted `lang` could inject a key the indexer would then prefer.
The separation of concerns was the defect. One JSON writer, here.

WHY SANITISE RATHER THAN ESCAPE. Correct JSON escaping is what a normal writer would do, and it
would break the reader: `jf()` in kit-index.sh matches `"[^"]*"` and cannot see past a `\"`. So
every string field is stripped of quote, backslash and control characters BEFORE serialisation,
which makes the emitted line both valid JSON and readable by that awk. `_assert_flat()` then
checks the invariant on the finished line rather than trusting the sanitiser.

WHY NO JSON SCHEMA FILE. One was built and deleted. `jsonschema` is not installed and the kit
promises no runtime dependencies, so a schema file meant hand-writing a subset interpreter of a
standard -- a second implementation, and a THIRD way to declare config beside the project
profile and the `--vocab` accessor. CONTRACT below is the one definition; `kit-finding.sh
--contract` is the door.

WHAT IS NOT CONFIGURABLE. `class` and `severity` are a SHARED taxonomy: the accelerators
aggregate findings across projects, and a per-project class list would make that meaningless.
`domain` is the axis that IS project-specific, and it is declared in the project profile.

Usage:
    kit_findings.py --contract                     the contract, for humans and agents
    kit_findings.py --validate         < json      exit 0 accepted, 2 rejected
    kit_findings.py --emit-events      < json      complete NDJSON event lines on stdout
        --task ID | --unattributed, --agent NAME, [--agent-id X] [--model M]
        [--industries "bfsi govtech"]  domains outside this list are dropped, as declared

`--emit-events` prints NOTHING unless every finding passed, so the caller can append its whole
output in one operation. A half-stored review is a finding table that disagrees with the review
it came from, and afterwards nobody can tell which half is missing.

    it cannot express it: `vindicated` says whether the finding was real, `fixed_at` whether it was
    addressed, `unassessable_at` whether either question can be answered from what survives.

    None of them fits a review that killed the thing it reviewed. `--fixed` would be false --
    nothing was fixed. `--unassessable` would be false and is mechanically refused anyway, because
    these findings carry summaries and are perfectly legible. `kit-vindicate.sh --false` is the
    worst of the three: they were REAL, and being real is why the subject was withdrawn.

    Measured 2026-08-19: 31 findings on one task review a design document whose successor opens by
    rejecting it. Without this verb they sit in the criticals gate permanently and that task can
    never close, no matter how much correct work is done on it.

    `--by` is REQUIRED and must be non-empty, for the reason `--reason` is required on an
    unassessable mark: a disposition that clears a gate without naming what cleared it is a
    clearance. It is NOT the whole guard -- kit-resolve.sh separately requires the subject file to
    carry a `Superseded-by:` line naming the same thing, so that the withdrawal is visible in the
