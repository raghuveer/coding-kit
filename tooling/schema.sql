-- the session's, and `legacy` marks rows written before 0.8.0, whose agent label named an
-- agent while the numbers came from the main loop. Never join agent identity to a row that
-- is not `subagent`.
--
-- `context` is the final context-window size, which is what the harness reports as
-- subagent_tokens. It is NOT cost and must never be summed as one -- it matched the harness
-- figure to 0.012% across 105 agents while the actual output work differed by up to 215x. It
-- is kept as a context-pressure signal, and because reproducing the harness number is how a
-- future reader checks the transcripts are still being read correctly.
--
-- task_id is derived, not recorded. The hook that fires when an agent finishes has no idea
-- which task it was serving, so spend is attributed afterwards to the next task-status
